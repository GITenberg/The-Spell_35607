<p>&ldquo;Now, Jack, here is a chance to put your knowledge
of the classics to some practical use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen Armstrong paused for a moment before
a Latin inscription cut in the upper stones of the
boundary wall, and leaned gratefully upon her companion&rsquo;s
arm after the steep ascent. &ldquo;What does it
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her husband smiled. &ldquo;That is an easy test. The
ancient legend conveys the cheering intelligence that
&lsquo;from this spot Florence and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span>, mother and daughter,
are equi-distant.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl released her hold upon the man&rsquo;s arm and,
pushing back a few stray locks which the wind had
loosened, turned to regard the panorama behind her.
It was a charmingly picturesque and characteristic
Italian roadway which they had chosen for their day&rsquo;s
excursion. On either side stood plastered stone walls,
which bore curious marks and circles, made&mdash;who shall
say when or by whom?&mdash;remaining there as an atavistic
suggestion of Etruscan symbolism. The whiteness of
the walls was relieved by tall cypresses and ilexes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
rose high above them, while below the branches, and reclining
upon the stone top, a profusion of wild roses
shed their petals and their fragrance for the benefit of
the passers-by. In the distance, through the trees,
showed the shimmering green of olive-groves and vineyards&mdash;covering
the hillsides, yet yielding occasionally
to a gay-blossoming garden; and, as if to complete by
contrast, the streaked peaks of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carrara</span> gave a faint suggestion
of their marble richness. In front, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span> rose
sheer and picturesque, while villas, scattered here and
there, some large and stately, some small, some antiquated
and others modernized, gave evidence that the
ancient <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Via della Piazzola</span> still expressed its own individuality
as in the days when the bishops of old trod its
paths in visiting their see at the top of the hill, and
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Boccaccio</span> and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sacchetti</span>, with their kindred spirits, made
its echoes ring with merry revelling. But, inevitably
turning again, the modern pilgrims saw far below them,
and most impressive of all, the languorous City of
Flowers, peacefully dreaming on either side of the silver
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arno</span>.</p>

<p>All this was a familiar sight to John Armstrong, whose
five years&rsquo; residence in Florence, just before entering
Harvard, made him feel entirely at home in its outskirts.
He preferred, therefore, to fix his eyes upon the face
of the girl beside him. She was tall and fair, with figure
well proportioned, yet the characteristic which left the
deepest impress was her peculiar sweetness of expression.
Among her Vincent Club friends she was universally considered
beautiful, and a girl&rsquo;s verdict of another girl&rsquo;s
beauty is rarely exaggerated. Her deep, merry, gray
eyes showed whence came the vivacity which ever made
her the centre of an animated group, while the sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and understanding which shone from them explained
her popularity.</p>

<p>The announcement of her engagement to Jack Armstrong
was the greatest surprise of a sensational Boston
season, not because of any unfitness in the match,&mdash;for
the Armstrong lineage was quite as distinguished as the
Cartwrights&rsquo;,&mdash;but because Helen had so persistently
discouraged all admiration beyond the point of friendship
and comradeship, that those who should have known
pronounced her immune.</p>

<p>But that was because her friends had read her character
even less correctly than they had Armstrong&rsquo;s.
They would have told you that she was distinctly a girl
of the twentieth century; he discovered that while tempered
by its progressiveness, she had not been marred by
its extremes. They would have said that her character
had not yet found opportunity for expression, since her
every wish had always been gratified; he would have explained
that the fact that she had learned to wish wisely
was in itself sufficient expression of the character which
lay beneath.</p>

<p>He watched her in the midst of the social life to which
they both belonged, entering naturally, as he did, into
its conventionalities as a matter of course, and he rejoiced
to find in her, beyond the enjoyment of those
every-day pleasures which end where they begin, a response
to the deeper thoughts which controlled his own
best expression. He could see that these new subjects
frightened her a little by their immensity, as he tried to
explain them; he sympathized with her momentary despair
when she found herself beyond her depth; but he
was convinced that the understanding and the interest
were both there, as in an undeveloped negative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>This same power of analysis which enabled him to
discover what all could not surmise had separated Armstrong,
in Helen&rsquo;s mind, from other men, nearer her own
age, whom she had known. She could hardly have put
in words what the difference was, but she felt that it
existed, and this paved the way for his ultimate success.
His personal attributes, inevitably tempered by the early
Italian influence, marked him as one considerably above
the commonplace. At college he had won the respect of
his professors by his strength of mind and tenacity of application,
and the affection of his fellow-students by his
skill in athletics and his general good-fellowship. Now,
eight years out of college, he had already made his place
at the Boston bar, and was regarded as a successful man
in his profession. But beyond all this, unknown even to
himself, Armstrong was an extremist. The seed had
been sown during that residence in Florence years before,
when unconsciously he had assimilated the enthusiasm
of an erudite librarian for the learning and achievements
of the master spirits of the past. Latin and Greek at
college had thus meant much more to him than dead
languages; in them he found living personalities
which inspired in him the liveliest ambition for emulation.</p>

<p>These were some of the subjects to which he introduced
Helen. Little by little he told her of the fascination
they possessed for him, of the treasures hidden beneath
their austere exterior. But the girl was perhaps
more interested by the charm of his presentation than by
the possibilities she saw in the subjects themselves. She
felt that she could understand him, and admitted her
respect for the objects of his enthusiasm, but she was
convinced that these were beyond her comprehension,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and frankly rebelled at the necessity of going back into
dead centuries for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love the present, and all that it contains,&rdquo; she
replied to him one day when something suggested the
subject during one of the many walks they took together;
&ldquo;I love the sky, the air, the sunshine, and the
flowers. Why should I go back to the past, made up of
memories only, when I may enjoy all this beautiful world
around me? And you, Jack&mdash;I should not have you if
I had lived in the past!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As her friends had said, she possessed strong ideas
about marriage, and expressed them without reserve.
Until Armstrong&rsquo;s irresistible wooing, she had decided,
as a result both of observation and of conclusion, that
admiration and attention from many were far to be preferred
to the devotion of any single one, and that matrimony
was neither essential nor desirable except under
ideal conditions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are so many things which seem more interesting
to me than a husband,&rdquo; Helen asserted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid that I agree too much with that wise old cynic
who said that &lsquo;love is the wine of life, and marriage
the dram-drinking.&rsquo; I insist on remaining a teetotaler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Armstrong felt himself entitled to enjoy a certain
degree of pride and satisfaction in that he had succeeded
in convincing her at last that the ideal conditions
she demanded had been met.</p>

<p>Even on board the steamer, at the start of their wedding
journey, as the familiar sky-line of New York became
less and less distinct, Armstrong read in his wife&rsquo;s
eyes, still gazing back at the vanishing city, the thoughts
which inevitably forced themselves upon her&mdash;a last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
remnant of her former doubt. When she turned and
saw him looking at her, she smiled guiltily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are leaving the old life behind us,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;With all the philosophy you have tried to teach me,
I have not fully realized until now what a change it
means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you regret it?&rdquo; he asked her, half rebellious that
even a passing shadow should mar the completeness of
their happiness.</p>

<p>Helen quickly became herself again, and threw back
her head with a merry laugh at the seriousness of his
interrogation. &ldquo;Regret it! How foolish even to ask
such a question! But you cannot wonder that the importance
of the event should force itself upon me, now
that we are actually married, even if it never did before.
It makes so much more of a change in a woman&rsquo;s life
than in a man&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen sighed, and then looked mischievously into his
face. &ldquo;With you superior beings,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;it
simply signifies a new latch-key, a new head to your
household, and the added companionship of a woman
whom you have selected as absolutely essential to your
happiness. You keep your old friends, give up for a
time a few of your bad habits, and transfer a part of
your affections from your clubs to your home. To the
woman, it means a complete readjustment. New duties
and responsibilities come to her all at once. From her
earliest memory she has been taught to depend upon the
counsel and guidance of her parents, but suddenly she
finds herself freed from this long-accustomed habit, with
a man standing beside her, only a few years her senior,
who is convinced that he can serve in this capacity far
better than any one else ever did. Even with a husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as superior as yourself, Mr. John Armstrong, is it not
natural that one should recognize the passing of the old
life, while welcoming the coming of the new?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After landing, they had lingered for a fortnight in
Paris, but, beneath the keen enjoyment of the attractions
there, Armstrong had felt an impatience, unacknowledged
even to himself, to reach Florence, which contained
for him so much of interest, and whither his memory&mdash;let
him give it sway&mdash;ever recalled him. He felt that
his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">dei familiares</i> were patiently waiting for him there,
indulgent in spite of his long absence, yet insistent that
their rights again be recognized. Having dropped his
engrossing law-practice, he yearned to take advantage
of this opportunity, now near at hand, to devote himself
to the girl he had won, and at the same time to gratify
this long-cherished wish to study more deeply into the
work of those early humanists who had foreshadowed and
brought about that mighty thought revolution, the wonderful
breaking-away from the deadly pall of ignorance
into the light and joyousness and richness of intellectual
life known as the Renaissance. Helen would no longer
fail to understand them when she saw them face to face.
He would lead her gently, even as <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> the librarian
had led him; and together they would draw from the
old life those principles which made it what it was, incorporating
them into their new existence, which would
thus be the richer and better worth the living. So now
that he had actually reached his goal, it was natural that
his contentment at finding himself in Florence with his
wife was intensified by the joy of being again amid the
scenes and personages which his imagination had taken
out from the indefiniteness of antiquity, and invested with
a living actuality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The sharp contrast of his two great devotions came
to John Armstrong as he stood at the cross-roads on
the edge of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Domenico</span>. The one had exerted so
powerful an influence on what he was to-day&mdash;the other
must influence his future to an extent even greater. The
one, in spite of the personality with which he had clothed
it, was as musty and antiquated as the ancient tomes
he loved to study; the other, as she stood there, her
cheeks aglow after the brisk walk, her face animated
with enthusiastic delight, seemed the personification of
present reality. What a force the two must make when
once joined together, contributing, each to the other,
those qualities which would else be lacking!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must take you yet a little higher,&rdquo; Armstrong
urged at length; &ldquo;these walls still cut off much of the
glorious view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few moments more they had partly ascended the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Via della Fiesolana</span>, which at this hour was wholly deserted.
With a sigh, half from satisfaction and half
from momentary fatigue, Helen turned to her companion.
She caught the admiration which his face so clearly reflected,
but, womanlike, preferred to feign ignorance of
its origin. Glancing about her, she discovered a rock,
half hidden by the tall grass and wild poppies, which
offered an attractive resting-place. Seating herself, she
plucked several of the brilliant blossoms, and began to
weave the stems together. At last she broke the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so quiet, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For three reasons,&rdquo; he replied, promptly. &ldquo;This
walk has made me romantic, poetic, and hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen laughed heartily. &ldquo;I am glad you added the
third reason, for by that I know that you are mortal.
This wonderful air and the marvellous view affect me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
exactly as a fairy-story used to, years ago. When I
turned I fully expected to find a fairy prince beside
me. You confess that you are romantic, which is becoming
in a five-weeks&rsquo;-old husband, but why poetic?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Poetry is but spoken painting,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Armstrong,
smiling; &ldquo;and I should be pleased indeed were
I able to put on canvas the picture I now see before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you cannot do that, suppose you write a sonnet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong met her arch smile firmly. The girlish
abandon under the influence of new surroundings awoke
in him a side of his nature which he had not previously
realized he possessed. Stooping, he gently held her face
between his hands and looked deep into her responsive
eyes before replying:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Say from what vein did Love procure the gold</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To make those sunny tresses? From what thorn</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Stole he the rose, and whence the dew of morn,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Bidding them breathe and live in Beauty&rsquo;s mould?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What depth of ocean gave the pearls that told</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Those gentle accents sweet, tho&rsquo; rarely born?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whence came so many graces to adorn</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That brow more fair than summer skies unfold?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Oh! say what angels lead, what spheres control</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The song divine which wastes my life away?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>(Who can with trifles now my senses move?)</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What sun gave birth unto the lofty soul</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of those enchanting eyes, whose glances stray</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To burn and freeze my heart&mdash;the sport of Love?</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Helen made no reply for several moments after Armstrong
ceased speaking. Then she held out her hand to
him and looked up into his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew before that you were a real poet,&rdquo; she
said, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I were&mdash;and such a poet! My precious
Petrarch, for whom you profess so little fondness, is
responsible for that most splendid tribute ever paid to
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was incredulous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sanctimonious old gentleman with the laurel
leaves on his head and the very self-confident expression
on his face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who spent all his life making love to another man&rsquo;s
wife from a safe distance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; this is one of his love-letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then if I accept those lines you just repeated with
so much feeling, I must be Laura?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not another man&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have been if you had acted like that, Jack.
Let me see how you look with a laurel wreath made of
poppies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew his head down and tied the flowers about his
forehead. Then, pushing him away from her, she clapped
her hands with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! if the noble Petrarch had looked like that,
Madonna Laura could surely never have resisted
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had Madonna Laura resembled Madonna Helen,
the worthy Petrarch would have had her in his arms
before she had the chance,&rdquo; laughed Armstrong, improving
his opportunity as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very gallant, Jack, but very improper.&rdquo; Helen
pursed her lips and looked up at him mischievously.
&ldquo;But let us forget your musty old antiquities and talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the present. Do you realize that this is the end of
our honeymoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, holding her more closely and laughing
down at her; &ldquo;it has only just begun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; assented Helen, disengaging herself,
&ldquo;but to-morrow we are to exchange the very romantic
titles of &lsquo;bride&rsquo; and &lsquo;bridegroom&rsquo; for the much more
commonplace &lsquo;host&rsquo; and &lsquo;hostess.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I am relieved that you are not going to divorce
me at once.&rdquo; Armstrong was amused at her seriousness.
&ldquo;But it was your idea to invite them to join us, was it
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it was&mdash;and now I must make a confession
to you. I thought that in five weeks we both would be
glad enough to have some little break in our love-making.
But I did not realize how rapidly five weeks could
pass. Still&rdquo;&mdash;Helen sighed&mdash;&ldquo;what is the use of having
a villa in Florence unless you can invite your friends
to see it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you have not become tired of your husband as
soon as you thought you would?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor you of your wife?&rdquo; Helen retorted, quickly.
&ldquo;Mamma suggested it first. She said that so long a
wedding trip as we had planned was sure to end with
one or both of us becoming hopelessly bored unless
we introduced other characters into our Garden of
Eden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she say &lsquo;Garden of Eden&rsquo;? That family party
included a serpent, if rumor be correct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there could not be one in ours, because I would
never give you the chance to say, &lsquo;The woman did
it.&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother forgets that we are exceptions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says there may be some difference in men, but
that all husbands are alike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trite and to the point, as always with mamma.&rdquo;
Armstrong paused and smiled. &ldquo;Well, I think even she
will be satisfied with the success of her suggestion. How
many do our guests number at present?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen dropped the flower she was idly swinging and
began to count upon her fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see. There is Inez Thayer&mdash;I am glad
that she could visit us, so that at last you can know
her. It is strange enough that you should not have
met her until the wedding. You cannot help liking each
other, for she is interested in all those serious things you
love so well. The girls used to make sport of our devotion
at school because our dispositions are so unlike:
she is thoughtful, while I am impulsive; she is carried
away with anything which is deep and learned, while I,
as you well know, have nothing more important in life
than you and my music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen paused for a moment thoughtfully. &ldquo;Sometimes
I wish I could really interest myself in those ancient
deities you worship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could if you only knew them as I do,&rdquo; he urged,
quietly. &ldquo;The present is the evolution of the past, but
it has been evolved so fast that many of the old-time
treasures have been forgotten in the mad pace of every-day
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t remember everything,&rdquo; Helen replied;
&ldquo;there are not hours enough in the day. I can&rsquo;t even
find time to read our modern writers as much as I wish I
could, and I think one ought to do that before going
back to the ancients.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All modern literature is based upon what has gone
before,&rdquo; insisted Armstrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo; Helen&rsquo;s face again became
thoughtful. &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; she cried, triumphantly.
&ldquo;&lsquo;The gardens of Sicily are empty now, but the bees
still fetch honey from the golden jars of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Theocritus</span>.&rsquo;
That is what you mean, is it not? I remember that
from something of Lowell&rsquo;s I read at school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; he laughed, with delight. &ldquo;Who dares
to say that you are not in sympathy with the past?&rdquo; He
bent his head down close to hers. &ldquo;Would you not prefer
to hold those &lsquo;golden jars&rsquo; in your very hands, sweetheart,
rather than merely read about them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Jack, &lsquo;the gardens of Sicily are empty now.&rsquo;
Think how lonesome we should be.&rdquo; Helen threw back
her head and drew in a long breath of the exhilarating
air.</p>

<p>Armstrong was still insistent. &ldquo;I wish I could make
you see it as I do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The present of to-day is
bound to be the past of to-morrow. What I want to
do is to assimilate all that the past can give me, so that
I may do my part, however small, toward giving it out
again, made stronger and more effective because of its
modern application, thus helping this present to become
worthy of being considered by those who come after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked up at him with undisguised admiration.
&ldquo;Oh, Jack, that sounds so wonderful, and I wish I could
enter into it with you, but I simply cannot do it. Inez
will be just the one. At school, as I told you, she went
in for the classics and all that, while I&mdash;well, I was
sent there to be &lsquo;finished.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t look so disappointed,
Jack. Truly I would if I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not give you up yet,&rdquo; he answered, smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
at Helen&rsquo;s intensity, notwithstanding his genuine regret.
&ldquo;Tell me something more about Miss Thayer, since you
insist upon her becoming your substitute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inez is a darling, in spite of her superiority,&rdquo; Helen
replied, gayly, &ldquo;and I simply could not have been married
without her for a bridesmaid. She would have sailed
two weeks earlier except for our wedding. As it was,
she came over with her cousins, and has been travelling
with them until time to join us here at the villa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;De Peyster is still devoted, I judge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Ferdinand! His persistency has quite won my
sympathy. He simply will not take &lsquo;no&rsquo; for an answer,
but travels back and forth between Boston and Philadelphia
like any commercial traveller. Going over, he
has a bunch of American Beauties under one arm and a
box of bonbons under the other; returning, nothing but
another refusal to add to those Inez has already given
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not a bad sort of chap at all, when you get
past his peculiarities,&rdquo; Armstrong added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ferdy is a splendid fellow, in his own way,&rdquo; assented
Helen, warmly, &ldquo;and any girl might do a great deal
worse than marry him; but he is not Inez&rsquo; style at all.
I believe her trip to Europe is really to get away from
him. I know he thinks that is the reason, and is simply
inconsolable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;De Peyster would be a good match,&rdquo; remarked Armstrong,
thoughtfully. &ldquo;He has plenty of money and
plenty of leisure, and he ought to be able to make his
wife fairly comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is not what Inez wants. She has great
ideas about affinities, and Ferdy does not answer to the
description.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is your uncle Peabody,&rdquo; Armstrong
prompted, helpfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is dear Uncle Peabody. You will enjoy
him immensely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he live up to his reputation of a man with an
&lsquo;ism&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack! Some one has been maligning him to
you. That is because he is the only original member of
our family, and really the most useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! If that is your estimate of him, it shall
also be mine. I was prepared for a well-developed specimen
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus</i> crank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see him.&rdquo; Helen laughed at her husband&rsquo;s
mental picture. &ldquo;He is a crank, in a way, but
he is a mighty cheerful one to have around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He believes in making an air-plant of one&rsquo;s self, in
order to help him forget his other troubles, does he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who has been making fun of dear Uncle Peabody?
I must have him tell you about his work himself. It
is true that he believes most people overeat, and it
is true that he is devoting his life and his fortune to
finding out what the basis of proper nutrition really is;
but as for starving&mdash;wait till you see him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have relieved me considerably,&rdquo; Armstrong replied,
gravely. &ldquo;From what I had heard of your uncle
I had expected nothing less than to be made an example
of for the sake of science&mdash;and you have already discovered
that I am really partial to my meals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can be just as partial to them as ever, Jack.
But, seriously, I know you will find him most interesting,
and I shall be surprised if his theories do not give you
something new to think about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His theories will not do for me,&rdquo; said Armstrong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
assuming a position of mock importance, &ldquo;for I have
always been taught that a touch of indigestion is absolutely
essential to genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;That will be just the
argument to start the conversation at our first dinner
and keep it from being commonplace. I have been trying
to think how we could get Uncle Peabody interested.
It is only that first dinner which I dread, and you have
helped me out nobly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes two,&rdquo; suggested Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, two. Then there are the Sinclair girls, who
have been studying here in Florence for nearly a year.
They will come up from their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pension</i>. That makes four&mdash;and
the others, you know, are Phil Emory and Dick
Eustis, who arrive in Florence from Rome to-night. I
don&rsquo;t need to tell you anything about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a whole lot you might tell me about Emory
if you chose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong looked slyly into his wife&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shame on you, Jack!&rdquo; Helen cried, flushing; &ldquo;the
idea of being jealous on your wedding trip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not jealous <em>now</em>.&rdquo; He emphasized the last
word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am glad you are over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks like a very jolly party,&rdquo; he hastened to add,
seeing that Helen&rsquo;s annoyance was genuine, &ldquo;and I can
see where we become old married folk to-morrow. You
and Uncle Peabody will act as chaperons, I presume,
Phil and Dick will look after the Sinclair girls, while I
am to devote myself to Inez Thayer. Is that the programme?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. I am so anxious that Inez should appreciate
what a talented husband I have. She has heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
great stories about your learning and erudition, so now
you must live up to the picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then suppose we start for home if you are quite
rested. It is plainly incumbent on me to make sure that
my knowledge of the classics proves equal to the test.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>The Armstrongs had installed themselves in the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span>, near <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Settignano</span>. The date for
the wedding was no sooner settled than Jack cabled
to secure what had always seemed to him to be the most
glorious location around Florence. Years before, his
favorite tramp had been out of the ancient city through
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Porta alla Croce</span> to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Mensola</span>, whence he delighted
to ascend the hill of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Settignano</span>. Every villa possessed a
peculiar fascination for him. The &ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Poggio Gherardo</span>&rdquo;&mdash;the
&ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Primo Palagio del Refugio</span>&rdquo; of the <span class="name">Decameron</span>&mdash;made
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Boccaccio</span> real to him. The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Buonarroti</span>,
whither <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span> was sent as a baby, after the Italian
custom, to be nursed in a family of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">scarpellini</i>, always
attracted him, and times without number he had
stood admiringly before the wall in one of the rooms,
gazing at the figure of the satyr which the infant
prodigy drew with a burning stick taken from the
fire. In those days he had been seized with a secret
yearning to become an artist, and often he had tried to
reproduce the satyr from memory, but always the ugly
visage assumed a mocking, sneering aspect which caused
him to relinquish his cherished ambition in despair.</p>

<p>But the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span> appealed to Armstrong for
a different reason. It stood high up on the hill, affording
a wonderful view of the village of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Settignano</span> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the wide-spreading valley of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arno</span>. The villa itself,
with its overhanging eaves, coigned angles, and
narrow windows, set on heavy consoles, was essentially
Tuscan, and impressive far out of proportion to its size.
It would have seemed too massive but for an arcade at
either end, the one connecting the house itself with
its chapel, the other leading from the first floor through
a spiral stairway in one pier of the arcade to what
originally, in the days of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gamberelli</span>, had been an
old fish-pond and herb-garden. In front of the villa
a row of antiquated stone vases shared the honors with
equally dilapidated stone dogs along a grassy terrace
held up by a low wall, while beyond this and the house
was the vineyard.</p>

<p>Armstrong had studied the plans of the house and
grounds from a distance, because, after his disappointing
experience with <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span>&rsquo;s satyr, he had firmly
determined to become an architect and to build Italian
houses in America. He had walked up and down the
long bowling-green behind the villa, carefully noting the
number of statues set upon the high retaining wall
and figuring the height of the hedges. One day old
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>, the sun-baked gardener who had watched the
boy first with suspicion and then with interest, invited
him to enter, and his joy had been complete. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>
showed him the fish-pond and the grotto, lying in the
shadow of the ancient cypresses, made up of varicolored
shells and stones, with shepherds and nymphs occupying
niches around a trickling fountain. He led him to the
balustrade at the end of the bowling-green, and pointed
out the panorama which terminated in the hills beyond
the southern bank of the river.</p>

<p>Parallel with the back of the villa was another wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
which supported a terrace of cypress and ilex trees.
Behind this was the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">salvatico</i>, without which no self-respecting
Italian villa could maintain its dignity, with
stone seats beneath the heavy foliage offering a grateful
relief from the glare of the sun. And here and there were
white statues of classic goddesses, to relieve the loneliness
had it existed. An iron gate, let into the wall opposite
the main doorway of the villa, led into a small garden,
this leading in turn into another grotto, which, with its
fountain and statues, formed an extension of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vista</i>.
On either side a balustraded flight of steps led up to
an artificial height&mdash;the Italians&rsquo; beloved <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">terrazza</i>&mdash;flanked
by rows of orange and lemon trees, growing
luxuriantly in their red earthen pots; while against the
wide balustrades rested the heavily scented clusters of
the camellia and the rose-tinted oleander.</p>

<p>Twelve years is a short space of time in Italy, where
age is reckoned by the millennial, so it seemed perfectly
natural, when Armstrong arrived in Florence, to find
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> still at his old post and included in the lease
as a part of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span>. The old man expressed
no surprise, no delight&mdash;yet at heart he was
well pleased. The previous tenants of the villa had
been the unimaginative family of a German-American
brewer, and their preference for beer over the wonderful
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vino rosso</i> which he himself had pressed out from the
luscious grapes in the vineyard filled his heart with sorrow.
He confided to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>, the red-lipped maid Armstrong
had engaged for Helen, that he &ldquo;was glad to
serve an &lsquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Americano molto importante</span>&rsquo; rather than a
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">porco</i>.&rdquo; And <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> took great satisfaction in placing
upon that last word all the emphasis needed to express
six months&rsquo; accumulated disgust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>From the moment the Armstrongs arrived, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>&rsquo;s
admiration for Helen knew no bounds. To him she was
the personification of all that was perfection. Not that
he expressed it, even to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>&mdash;he would have forgotten
mass on Good Friday sooner than so forget his place.
It was rather that devotion which is born and not made&mdash;occasionally,
but not often, found in those who enter so
intimately into the life of those they serve, yet who
must always feel themselves apart from it. Hardly a
day had passed since the Armstrongs had assumed possession
of the villa that Helen had not found the choicest
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fragole</i> at her plate, each juicy berry carefully selected
and resting upon a bed of its own leaves at the bottom
of the little basket. Her room was ever redolent with
the odor of the flowers he smuggled in, always unobserved;
and his instructions to the more frivolous <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>
as to her duties toward the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">nobile donna</i> were such as to
cause that young woman to throw her head haughtily on
one side, with the observation that she was probably as
well acquainted with the requirements of a lady&rsquo;s maid as
any gardener was apt to be, even though he <em>were</em> old
enough to be her grandfather.</p>

<p>This particular tiff had taken place while Armstrong
and his wife were making their excursion to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span>.
On their return they had found <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> in a morose
mood, which quickly vanished when Helen told him, in
her broken Italian, that she expected guests upon the
morrow, and depended upon him to see that every room
was properly decorated, as he alone could do it. The
old man could hardly wait to arrange the chairs upon
the veranda, so eager was he to seek revenge upon his
youthful tormentor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she ask you to arrange the flowers, young peacock-feather?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
asked <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span> when he found
her in the kitchen. &ldquo;Did she trust you even to bring
the message to old <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>? No. With her own lips
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Eccellenza</i> praised the one servant on whom she
can rely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knows you are good for nothing else,&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>
retorted, with a scornful laugh and a toss of her pretty
head; &ldquo;and she wishes to get you out of the way while
we attend to the really important matters. See,&rdquo; she
cried, as the tinkling of the maids&rsquo; bell punctuated her
remarks, &ldquo;the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">nobile donna</i> will now give <em>me</em> commands.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> could not so far forget his dignity as to reply
to such an outrageous slander, so he contented
himself with casting upon <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span> his most withering
glances as she hastily brushed past him, holding back her
skirts lest they be defiled by touching the old man. He
watched her angrily until she vanished through the door,
then, with the choicest maledictions at his command,
he shuffled into the garden&mdash;into his own domain, where
the present generation of ill-bred servants, as he explained
to himself, could vex him not.</p>

<p class="r3">Mrs. John Armstrong&rsquo;s first dinner at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span>
was an unqualified success. Uncle Peabody had
arrived early that morning; his optimism had set its seal
of approval upon the evident happiness of the bridal
couple, and he had already established himself as chief
reflector of the concentrated joy which he saw about him.
Inez Thayer was received into Helen&rsquo;s welcoming arms
soon after luncheon, and was at once installed in the best
guest-chamber for an extended visit. Two dusty <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetture</i>
brought the Sinclair girls, Emory and Eustis, in time for
dinner, each driver striving to deliver his passengers first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in anticipation of an extra <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pourboire</i>. The company was
therefore complete, and each member quite in the spirit
of the occasion.</p>

<p>The great candelabra cast their light upon the animated
party seated about the table in such a manner
that the old paintings hanging upon the walls of the
high room were but dimly visible. The long windows
were open, and the light breeze just cooled the air
enough to mellow the temperature, without so much as
causing the candle-flames to flicker. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>&rsquo;s choicest
flowers, deftly arranged upon the table by Helen&rsquo;s skilful
hands, contrasted pleasantly with the antique silver
and china which had once been the pride of the original
owner of the villa; and the menu itself, wisely intrusted
by Helen to the old Italian cook, was rife with constant
surprises for the American palate. Even the wines were
new&mdash;if not in name, at least in flavor, for Italian vintages
leave behind them their native richness and aroma
when transplanted. Never was any <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vino rosso</i> so delicious
as that which <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> made, even though unappreciated
by his former master; never such <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lacrima
Christi</i> as that which Armstrong secured in a little wine-shop
near the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bargello</span>; never such <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Asti spumante</i> as
that which sparkled in the glasses, eager to share its own
bubbling happiness in return for the privilege of touching
the fair lips of the beautiful <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">donne Americane</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had a friend of yours on board ship, Miss
Thayer,&rdquo; said Emory, speaking to his left-hand neighbor
as they seated themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A friend of mine?&rdquo; queried Inez. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think
who it could be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ferdy De Peyster,&rdquo; replied Emory.</p>

<p>Inez cast a quick glance at Helen. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
asked. &ldquo;I thought he was going to spend the summer
at Bar Harbor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Changed his mind at the last moment,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Could not resist the charms of Italy. Do you know,
Helen&rdquo;&mdash;Emory addressed himself to his hostess&mdash;&ldquo;De
Peyster has developed a mania for art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen laughed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that is news
indeed. It is a side of Ferdy&rsquo;s nature which even his
best friends had not suspected. Is he coming to Florence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say; but he is evidently planning to leave
Rome. We left him at the Vatican, in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pinacoteca</span>,
standing before <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Raphael</span>&rsquo;s &lsquo;Transfiguration.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a Baedeker in his hand?&rdquo; queried Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, studying Cook&rsquo;s Continental Time-table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a detective you would make, Mr. Emory,&rdquo;
suggested Mary Sinclair as the laughter subsided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a better story about De Peyster than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eustis waited to be urged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to us, Dick,&rdquo; said Jack, helpfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was at Gibraltar,&rdquo; began Eustis. &ldquo;We were
in the same party going over the fortifications. De
Peyster, you know, enlisted at the time of the Spanish
war. Some family friend in the Senate obtained for
him a berth as second lieutenant, and his company got
as far as Key West. He rather prides himself on his
military knowledge, and he confided to me that he had
his uniform with him in case he was invited to attend any
Court functions. Well, all the way around De Peyster
explained everything to us. The Tommy Atkins who
was our guide was as serious as a mummy, but confirmed
everything Ferdy said. When you reach the gallery at
the top, you remember, the guide points out the parade-ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
below, and it happened that there was a battalion
going through its evolutions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said De Peyster, &lsquo;this is very interesting.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Then he described each movement, giving it the technical
military name. At last he turned to our guide and
said, patronizingly: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a bit disappointed, sergeant,
after all I have heard of the precision of the English
army. I have often seen American soldiers go through
those same movements&mdash;just as well as that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sergeant saluted respectfully and gravely.
&lsquo;Quite likely, sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;quite likely. These are
raw recruits&mdash;arrived yesterday, sir!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;De Peyster was a sport, though,&rdquo; added Emory.
&ldquo;When he saw that the joke was on him he handed
Tommy a shining sovereign and said: &lsquo;Here, sergeant,
have this on me, and drink a health to our two armies&mdash;may
comparisons never be needed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen clapped her hands. &ldquo;Good for Ferdy! He
is all right if people would only leave him alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad he has so much money!&rdquo; Eustis was reflective.
&ldquo;If De Peyster had to get out and hustle a
bit you would find he had a whole lot of stuff in him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he has,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know Mr. De Peyster?&rdquo; Inez asked, surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to after
hearing Mr. Eustis&rsquo;s summary. On general principles,
every one has &lsquo;a whole lot of stuff in him.&rsquo; The trouble
is that people don&rsquo;t give it a chance to come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your confidence is evidently based upon your general
optimism?&rdquo; Armstrong remembered that Helen
had mentioned this as a cardinal characteristic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but proved by a thousand and one experiments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Our present subject, who now becomes No. 1002, is apparently
handicapped by the misfortune of inherited
leisure. It is rarely that a man of possession reaches
his fullest development without the spur of necessity.
More frequently we see one extreme or the other&mdash;too
much possession or too much necessity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all very well as a theory, but does it really
prove anything as regards De Peyster?&rdquo; questioned
Armstrong. &ldquo;Personally I think optimism is a dangerous
thing. This confidence that everything is coming
out right is what makes criminals out of bank
cashiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a vast difference between real and false
optimism,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;I knew a man
once who called himself a cheerful pessimist, because
every time he planted a seed it grew down instead of
up. He came to expect this, so it did not worry him
any. He was a real optimist, even though he did not
know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would be your prescription for a case like Mr.
De Peyster&rsquo;s?&rdquo; queried Bertha Sinclair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good wife, possessed of ambition, sympathy, and
tact,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody replied, promptly. &ldquo;This, my
dear Miss Sinclair, is your opportunity to assist me
in proving my argument. Will you be my accomplice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? Why, I don&rsquo;t even know Mr. De Peyster,&rdquo;
Bertha protested. &ldquo;You must find some one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Cartwright. &ldquo;You see how
difficult it is for science to assert its laws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen caught sight of Inez&rsquo; cheeks and hastened to
her friend&rsquo;s relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Peabody, do you know that you are responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
for the first difference of opinion which has arisen
between my husband and me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My gracious, no! Can it be possible?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a fact. I stated to him only yesterday that
perfect digestion was the only basis on which health
and happiness can possibly rest. You taught me that,
but Jack asserts that a touch of indigestion is absolutely
essential to genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does he know? Has he a touch of indigestion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a touch,&rdquo; laughed Armstrong, &ldquo;and that
proves my statement. I really believe I might have
been a genius if my digestion had not always been so
disgustingly strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t despair, my dear boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody looked at Jack over his spectacles.
&ldquo;Genius is a germ, and sometimes develops late in life.
If your theory is correct, a few more gastronomic orgies
such as this will make you eligible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is there not something in what I say?&rdquo; Armstrong
persisted, seriously. &ldquo;Is it not true that good
health is against intellectual progression? Is not good
health the supremacy of the physical over the mental?
The healthy man is an animal&mdash;he eats and sleeps too
much. Pain and suffering have not developed the nervous
side, which is so closely connected with the intellectual.
When the physical side becomes weakened, then
the brain begins to act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody listened attentively and then removed
his spectacles. &ldquo;My dear Jack Armstrong,&rdquo; he said, at
last, &ldquo;I can see some fun ahead for both of us, and
Helen has placed me still further in her debt by her
choice of a husband. Your argument is not a new one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
It was invented a great many years ago in France by
some clever person who wished to have an excuse for
late nights, absinthe, and cigarettes. Do you mean
seriously to advance a theory which, if logically carried
through to the end, would credit hospitals and homes
for the hopelessly depraved with being the highest intellectual
establishments in the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But look at the examples which can be cited,&rdquo;
Armstrong continued, undisturbed. &ldquo;Zola produced
nothing of importance after he adopted the simple life,
and Swinburne&rsquo;s poetry lost all its fire as soon as he
&lsquo;reformed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you prove in either case that the question
of nutrition or digestion entered into the matter at
all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it may have been a coincidence, of course; but
many other cases might be added.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody was silent for a moment. &ldquo;Let me
give you a simple problem,&rdquo; he said, at length. &ldquo;Helen
tells me that you have an automobile now on its way to
Florence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong assented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When it arrives I presume you will engage a chauffeur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has an automobile to do with nutrition, Mr.
Cartwright?&rdquo; demanded Mary Sinclair. &ldquo;Surely an
automobile has no digestion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My application is near at hand. When you engage
that chauffeur I presume you will insist that he knows
the mechanism of the machine, understands the application
of the motive power and other details which enter
into safe and successful handling of the car?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;I am not introducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
my machine here for the purpose either of murder or
suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. That is just what I wanted you to say.
Now, every human stomach is an engine which requires
at least as intelligent handling as that of an automobile.
Upon its successful working depends the mechanical
action of the body. We may disregard the additional
dependence of the brain. Petroleum in the automobile
is replaced by what we call food in the human engine.
Too much of either, unintelligently applied, produces
the same unfortunate result. Now I ask you, John Armstrong,
would you engage as chauffeur for your automobile
a man who knew no more about the mechanism of
its engine, or how to feed and handle it properly, than
you yourself know about your own body engine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Armstrong admitted, frankly, &ldquo;I would not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But which is more serious&mdash;a damage resulting
from his ignorance or from your own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Cartwright,&rdquo; said Jack, laughingly,
&ldquo;you promised that there was fun ahead for us both.
At present it seems to be mostly for you and our
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who started the discussion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen; but I admit my error in being drawn into it.
I had not expected to be convicted upon my own evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen rose. &ldquo;I must rescue my husband from the
calamity I have brought upon him. Come, let us have
our coffee in the garden.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>If one could have looked within Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s room
after the other guests had snuffed out their candles,
he would have discovered its inmate seated beside the
flickering light with an open letter in his hand. He
had read it over many times since its receipt nearly
three months earlier, announcing in Helen&rsquo;s characteristic
way her engagement and approaching marriage.
No one else had ever come so closely into his life, and he
felt a certain responsibility to satisfy himself that the
girl had made no mistake in the important step which
she had taken. Now that he had actually met her husband,
he again perused the lines which had introduced
his new nephew to him.</p>

<p class="r2">&ldquo;<i>It has actually happened at last</i>,&rdquo; the letter began,
&ldquo;<i>and your favorite wager of &lsquo;a thousand to one on the
unexpected&rsquo; has really won. In other words, I, Helen
Cartwright, condemned (by myself) to live and die an
old maid as penalty for being so critical of the genus
homo, now confess myself completely, hopelessly in love,
and so happy in my new estate that I wonder why I ever
hesitated.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>It is all so curious. The things which interested me
before now seem so commonplace compared to the events
to come in connection with this broader existence which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
is opening up before me. How infinitely more gratifying
it is to feel myself living for and a part of another&rsquo;s
life, how comforting to know that some other personality,
whom I can love and respect, feels himself to be
living for and a part of my life. It adds to the seriousness
of it all, but how it increases the satisfaction!</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I wish I could describe John Armstrong to you, but
now that I am about to make the attempt I realize how
difficult a task I have undertaken. He is eight years
older than I, but sometimes he seems to be years younger,
while again I feel almost like a child beside him. No,
Uncle Peabody, it is not a similar case to that little Mrs.
Johnson whom you quoted when you were last home as
saying that a woman feels as old as the way her husband
treats her. I know this will pop into your mind, so I
will promptly head you off. The fact is that Jack is
a very remarkable man. He is handsome, with great
strength of character showing in every feature, he is
tall and athletic,&mdash;but it is his wonderful mental ability
which will most impress you. Think of a man playing
on the Harvard &rsquo;Varsity eleven, rowing on the crew, and
yet graduating with a</i> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa cum laude</span>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Jack is a superb dancer, thus disproving the common
belief that a man can&rsquo;t be clever at both ends; and
at the Assemblies, even before we were engaged, I used
to anticipate those numbers which he had taken more
than all the others. Besides this, his conversation was
always so original,&mdash;touching frequently upon topics
which were new to me. His particular fad is what he
calls &lsquo;humanism&rsquo; and his particular loves the great
writers of the past,&mdash;his &lsquo;divinities,&rsquo; as he calls them.
You probably understand just what all this means, but,
alas! most of it is beyond my comprehension! What he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
tells me interests me, of course,&mdash;it even fascinates me.
I can follow him up to a certain point; then we reach
my limitations, and I am forced to admit my lack of
understanding. That is when I feel so like an infant
beside him. He is as patient as can be, and insists that
when once I am in Florence, where the air itself is heavy
with the learning of the past, I shall be able to comprehend
it all, and it will mean the same to me that it does
to him. I wish I felt as confident!</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>We are to be married in April, and Jack has taken
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span> in <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Settignano</span> for the season. We
expect to arrive there early in May, and we want you
to come to us for just as long a visit as you can arrange.
You won&rsquo;t disappoint me, will you, dear Uncle Peabody?
We all have been broken-hearted that you have so long
delayed your return, and one of the events in our plans
for Florence to which I am looking forward with the
greatest eagerness is this visit with you. Write and tell
me how your work progresses, but don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;I told you
so.&rsquo; This would show that you really expected it all the
time, and your favorite argument would lose its force.
Just say that you will come to us at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Settignano</span>.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="r2">The letter itself showed that Helen had changed much
during the months which had elapsed since he had last
seen her. There was a more serious undertone and a
broader outlook,&mdash;due undoubtedly to Armstrong&rsquo;s influence.
Uncle Peabody wondered whether Helen could
have been attracted to this man by her admiration for
his mental strength rather than by any real sentiment,
perhaps mistaking the one for the other. This was the
point he wished to settle in his own mind, and this was
why he had studied them both, from the moment of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
arrival, much more carefully than either one of them
realized.</p>

<p>Armstrong was a remarkable man, as Helen had said.
Even in the few hours he had known him, Uncle Peabody
found much to admire. It was true that his manner
toward Helen showed indulgence, almost as to a
child rather than to a wife; but his devotion was entirely
obvious, and this relation was to be expected after reading
Helen&rsquo;s letter. Still, Mr. Cartwright told himself,
the existence of this relation necessitated a certain readjustment
before a perfection of united interests could be
attained. Armstrong was bound to be the dominating
force, and Helen must inevitably respond to this new influence,
strange as it now seemed to her. His knowledge
of her sympathetic and intuitive grasp of his own pet
theories gave him confidence to believe that this response
would be equally prompt and comprehensive.</p>

<p>Henry Peabody Cartwright was distinctly a citizen of
the world. Boston had been his birthplace, Boston had
been the base of his eminently successful business operations,
and his name still figured in the list of the city&rsquo;s
&ldquo;largest taxpayers.&rdquo; Beyond this, the city of his early
activity had, during the past twenty years, seen him
only as a visitor at periodic intervals. He had emerged
from his commercial environment at the age of forty,
with a firm determination to gratify his ideals.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, and for mankind as well, his
ideals were not fully crystallized when he set out to
gratify them. Boston was entirely satisfactory to him
as an abiding-place, but he felt a leaven at work within
him which demanded a larger arena than even the outlying
territory of Greater Boston covered. He started,
therefore, in the late eighties for a trip around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
world, with the definite purpose, as he himself announced,
of &ldquo;giving things a chance to happen to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no schedule and no plans,&rdquo; he said to those
who questioned him. &ldquo;I shall &lsquo;hitch my wagon to a
star,&rsquo; but always with my grip near at hand, so that I
may change stars upon a moment&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were no immediate family ties to interfere with
the carrying-out of what seemed to his friends to be
rather quixotic ideas. There may have been some youthful
romance, but, if so, no one ever succeeded in learning
anything of it from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all perfectly simple,&rdquo; he once good-naturedly
replied to a persistent relative. &ldquo;The girls I was willing
to marry would not have me, and those who would
have me I was not willing to marry. I used to think
that I would become more attractive as I grew older,
but I have given up that idea now. Once I tried to rub
a freckle off with sand-paper and pumice-stone and
found blood under the skin; but the freckle&mdash;the same
old freckle&mdash;is there to this day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His devotion to women in the composite was consistent
and sincere; the fondness which existed between himself
and his brother&rsquo;s family was such that his departure
had left a distinct void, and his visits home were events
circled with red ink in the family calendar. He enjoyed
these visits no less than they; but with never more than a
day or two of warning he would announce his intention
of leaving for Egypt or India or some spot more or less
remote in his quest for the unexpected. To the reproaches
which were levelled at him, he replied, with a
smile which defied controversy:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am just as sorry not to be with you all as you can
possibly be to have me away; but I have educated myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to the separation, and have thus overcome the necessity
for personal propinquity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On that first trip around the world Uncle Peabody
found one of his ideals, although he did not realize its
vast importance until several years later. Japan appealed
to him, and the longer he remained there the more
impressed he became with certain of the national characteristics.
First of all, he marvelled at the evenness of
temper which the people displayed, at their endurance,
their patience. He watched the carefulness with which
they weighed the importance of each problem before
accepting its responsibility, and their utter abandon in
carrying it through when once undertaken. This was
twenty years before the Russo-Japanese war, and he
had come among them with the existing Occidental
estimate of their paganism and barbarity. It may have
been a species of incredulity leading to curiosity which
induced him to remain among them, but as a result of
his sojourn he discovered that they were philosophers
rather than fatalists, geniuses rather than barbarians.</p>

<p>He questioned his new hosts, when he came to know
them better, and was told quite seriously and quite
naturally that they never became angry, because anger
produced poison in the system and retarded digestion;
that upon digestion depended health; that upon
health depended happiness, and upon happiness depended
personal efficiency and life itself. They explained
that forethought was one of the cardinal factors of their
creed, but added that its antithesis, fear-thought, was
equally important as an element to be eliminated. They
called his attention to the fact that they did not live
upon what they ate, but upon what they digested, and
that by masticating their food more thoroughly than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
did they secured from the smaller quantity the same
amount of nourishment without needlessly overloading
their systems with undigested food which could not possibly
be assimilated.</p>

<p>This last theory did not altogether appeal to Peabody
Cartwright at first. His friends at the Somerset
Club still held memories of his epicurean proclivities,
and they were not weary even yet of recalling the time
when he had won a goodly wager by naming, blindfolded,
five different vintages of Burgundy and Bordeaux.
But the more he thought it over the more convinced he
became that the something to which he had promised
to give a chance had really happened to him. He pondered,
he experimented&mdash;but he still continued to eat
larger quantities of food than the Japanese.</p>

<p>A year later he was in Italy, and in Venice Mr.
Cartwright suddenly discovered that he had found the
geographical centre of the civilized world. With Venice
as the starting-point, one could reach London or Constantinople,
St. Petersburg or New York, with equal exertion.
Venice, therefore, became his adopted home, although
it could claim no more of his presence than any
one of a dozen other cities in the four quarters of the
globe. During the twenty years, he had succeeded in
making himself a part of each one&mdash;had become a veritable
citizen of the world, but by no means a man without
a country.</p>

<p>Italy served to drive home the truths which Japan
had first shown him. Three years after his experience
there, a dingy, second-hand book-store in Florence
had placed him in possession of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Luigi Cornaro</span>&rsquo;s <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Discorsi
della Vita Sobria</i>. He read it with amazement.
Here in his hand, written by a Venetian nobleman more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
than three hundred years before, at the age of eighty-three,
was the text-book of the theories of life which he
had accepted from the Japanese as new and untried
except among this alien people! It gave him a start,
and he journeyed to Turin, Berne, Berlin, Brussels,
Paris, London, St. Petersburg, and even back to Boston,
seeking to interest the famous physiologists in his discovery,
which he believed was destined to exterminate
disease and to transform those practising the medical
profession into hygienic engineers.</p>

<p>Mr. Cartwright&rsquo;s name and personality preserved him
from a sanitarium, but his theories as to self-control,
forethought, and fear-thought received ample opportunity
for personal experiment. He was as tenacious
as if his future depended upon the outcome. A good-natured
indulgence here, and an incredulous sympathy
there, gave him his first opportunities for demonstration.
He not only drew upon his fortune, but freely
contributed himself as a subject for experiment. It
had been slow, but he had learned patience from the
Japanese. Disbelief gradually changed into doubt,
doubt into question, question into half-belief, and half-belief
into conviction. Quietly, surely, his own faith
was assimilated by those high in the physiological ranks,
and almost against their will, and before they realized
the importance of their concessions, he had forced them
to prove him right by their own analyses.</p>

<p>The last five years had been a steady triumph. He
had found his ideals, but he had not attained them. He
knew what his life-work was, and had the gratification
of counting among his friends and collaborators the
highest authorities the world recognized. The habits
of generations could not be changed in a moment&mdash;some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of them could never be changed; but the ball had been
started and was gaining in size with each revolution.
It no longer needed his gentle, persuasive push; it had
its own momentum now, and he found it only necessary
to guide its advance and to watch its growth.</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s thoughts reverted to his work as he
folded Helen&rsquo;s letter and placed it again in his pocket,
where he had so long carried it. He regretted having
his labors interrupted just now, but he found himself
keenly interested to watch Helen&rsquo;s approaching evolution.
His wagon was firmly hitched to this new star,
and he had no notion of changing stars. So, with a
murmured &ldquo;Bless you, my children. May you live forever,
and may I come to your funeral,&rdquo; he sought the
repose which the others had already found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>Mary and Bertha Sinclair were just completing a
year&rsquo;s study in Florence, upon which they were
depending to perfect their musical education; but
both girls were sufficiently homesick after their two years&rsquo;
absence from Boston to be more than eager to exchange
their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pension</i> for a week&rsquo;s visit with Helen, who brought
to them a fresh budget of home news,&mdash;for which their
eagerness increased as the date for their return to America
drew nearer. Emory and Eustis, too, added familiar
faces, so the days following the first dinner at the villa
proved to be full of interest and enjoyment to all concerned.</p>

<p>The guests became familiar with each portion of the
house and grounds, the mysteries of Italian house-keeping
were contrasted with the limitations of boarding,
and numerous topics of common import succeeded
each other without surcease.</p>

<p>During the morning following the arrival of the
guests, Armstrong touched tentatively upon the subject
of visiting the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We went there when we first came to Florence,&rdquo;
Mary Sinclair replied; &ldquo;and we saw everything there
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong smiled indulgently, thinking of the little
they had really seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You know we are not very literary,&rdquo; explained
Bertha, catching the expression upon his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are really more hopeless cases even than I,&rdquo;
Helen added, sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try Phil and me?&rdquo; inquired Emory.
&ldquo;We went through the Vatican library, so we are experts.
At least they said it was a library. The only
books we saw there were a few in show-cases&mdash;the rest
they kept out of sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would not recognize a real book if you saw it,
Emory,&rdquo; Armstrong replied, with resignation. &ldquo;There
is no hurry. Perhaps Miss Thayer will go with me
some day soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I will,&rdquo; Inez responded, with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;There is nothing I wish so much to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; His appreciation was sincere. &ldquo;I shall
take real delight in introducing to you my old-time
friends, with whom I often differ but, never quarrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they so real to you as that?&rdquo; Inez asked, impressed
by his tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are indeed,&rdquo; Armstrong replied, seriously.
&ldquo;I visit and talk with them just as I would with you
all. But they have an aggravating advantage over
me, for, no matter how laboriously I argue with
them, their original statement stands unmoved there
upon the written page, as if enjoying my feeble effort
to disturb its serenity, and defying me to do my
worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would much prefer to give them an absent treatment,&rdquo;
asserted Eustis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inez is clearly the psychological subject,&rdquo; Helen
added. &ldquo;At school she was forever putting us girls to
shame by her mortifying familiarity with the classics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
It is only fair that she should now be paid in her own
coin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I accept both the invitation and the challenge,&rdquo; replied
Inez, bowing to her hostess, and, walking over to
the low wall on which Helen had seated herself, she
threw her arm affectionately about her neck. &ldquo;But
you must not embarrass me with such praise, or your
husband will suffer a keen disappointment. To study
Latin and Greek out of school-books is one thing; to
meet face to face the personalities one has regarded as
divinities&mdash;even reading their very handwriting&mdash;is another.
It makes one wonder if she ever did know anything
about them before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is exactly the spirit in which to approach the
shrine, Miss Thayer!&rdquo; cried Armstrong, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Let us frame a new beatitude: &lsquo;Blessed is she who appreciates
the glories of antiquity, for she shall inherit
the riches of the past.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contrast of the two girls in the rich Italian morning
light was so striking that Uncle Peabody paused
in his approach after a successful attack upon the
rose-bushes, touched Armstrong upon the shoulder, and
nodded admiringly in their direction. They were separated
a little from the others, and were busily engaged
in a conversation of their own, in which no man hath a
part, quite oblivious to the attention they attracted.
Inez was standing, and, even though seated, Helen&rsquo;s
superb head reached quite to her companion&rsquo;s shoulder,
and the fair hair and complexion were clearly
defined against the darker hue of the face and head
bent down to meet her own. Her eyes, looking out
into the distance even as she spoke, reflected the calm,
satisfied contentment of the moment, while in the brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
depths of the other&rsquo;s one could read an ungratified ambition,
an uncertainty not yet explained. Inez Thayer&rsquo;s
face was attractive, Helen&rsquo;s was beautiful&mdash;that beauty
which one feels belongs naturally to the person possessing
it without the necessity of analysis.</p>

<p>Armstrong was evidently pleased with this comparison,
as he had been with all previous ones. Italy, it seemed
to him, formed just the background to set off to best
advantage his wife&rsquo;s personal attractions. Uncle Peabody
smiled contentedly at the undisguised satisfaction
which was so clearly indicated in the younger man&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there had been any girls in Boston who looked
like that when I was of sparking age,&rdquo; he whispered to
Armstrong, &ldquo;I should certainly have married and settled
down, as I ought to have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And allowed the world to perish of indigestion?&rdquo;
queried Armstrong, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scoffer! you do not deserve your good-fortune.
Come, these roses are becoming all thorns. Young
ladies, may I intrude upon your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tte--tte</i> long enough
to present you with the trophies of my after-breakfast
hunt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand apologies, Uncle,&rdquo; cried Helen, taking
the roses in her arms and burying her face in their
fragrant petals. &ldquo;Oh! how beautiful! And how idiotic
ever to leave this Garden of Paradise and immure yourselves
within that musty old library. Do you not repent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I place the decision wholly in Miss Thayer&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo;
said Armstrong; but he glanced at Inez with evident expectancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p><p>&ldquo;Then I decide to go,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;I am
quite impatient to meet the friends in whose good company
Mr. Armstrong revelled before his present reincarnation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; asked Armstrong, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid! I will order the carriage at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is rapid transit for you!&rdquo; exclaimed Eustis.
&ldquo;Jack believes in striking while the iron is hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a narrow escape we have had,&rdquo; murmured
Mary Sinclair, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Helen, resignedly. &ldquo;It may be
just as well to have it over. Jack has been looking forward
to this ever since he turned his face toward Florence,
and he will be quite miserable until he has actually
gratified his anticipation.&mdash;But don&rsquo;t be away long, will
you, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Thayer will very likely find the staid company
which we plan to keep quite as stupid as the rest
of you anticipate,&rdquo; replied Armstrong, &ldquo;so we may be
home sooner than you expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez had already disappeared in-doors to put on her
hat, and Armstrong started out to call a carriage.
Helen intercepted him as he crossed the veranda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind if I don&rsquo;t go with you to-day, will
you, Jack? If it were just to see the treasures at the
library I would urge them all to go; but I know what
is in your mind, dear. Truly, I will go with you some
time, and you shall try your experiment upon me; but
I am not in the mood for it just now. I ought not to
leave the others, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all right, of course,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I wish
you did feel like going, but your substitute seems to be
enthusiastic enough to make up for your antipathy.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call it that,&rdquo; Helen answered, half-reproachfully;
&ldquo;it is simply that I am ashamed to have my ignorance
exposed,&mdash;and it will give you such a splendid
chance really to know Inez. Now run along and have a
good time, and tell me all about it when you come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="r3">The little one-horse victoria soon left the villa behind,
and was well along on the narrow descending road
before either of its occupants broke the silence. As
if by mutual consent, each was thinking what neither
would have spoken aloud. Helen had not seen the expression
of disappointment which passed over her husband&rsquo;s
face as she spoke. He would have given much
if it might have been his wife beside him. He had
studied the girl carefully, and had found in her an intuitive
sympathy with the very subjects concerning
which she disclaimed all knowledge. At first he had
thought that she exaggerated her limitations because
of his deeper study, but he soon discovered her absolute
sincerity. It was a lack of confidence in herself,
he inwardly explained, and when once in Florence he
would give her that confidence which was the only element
lacking to her complete understanding. But as
yet he had been unable to get her inside the library, or
even within range of the necessary atmosphere.</p>

<p>Inez Thayer&rsquo;s thoughts were upon the same subject,
but from a different standpoint. Her last words to
Helen, when Uncle Peabody had interrupted their conversation,
framed a mild reproach. &ldquo;If I had won a
man like Jack Armstrong,&rdquo; Inez whispered to her, &ldquo;I
would not allow any one, not even you, to take my place
on an excursion such as this, upon which he has so set
his whole heart.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a sweet little harmonizer, Inez,&rdquo; Helen had
answered, smilingly, &ldquo;but you are a silly child none the
less. Jack and I understand each other perfectly. He
knows my limitations, and, if I went, I should only
spoil his full enjoyment. You will understand it and
revel in it, and he will be supremely happy. If you were
not so much better fitted naturally for this sort of thing,
of course I should go rather than disappoint him, but,
truly, the arrangement is much better as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez had no opportunity to continue the conversation,
but Helen had not convinced her. Hers was an intense
nature, and she had much more of the romantic in her
soul than her best friends gave her credit for. Her one
serious love-affair had proved only an annoyance and
mortification. Ferdinand De Peyster was in many ways
a desirable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti</i>, as mammas with marriageable daughters
were quite aware. He was possessed of a handsome
competency, was not inconvenienced by business responsibilities,
and his devotion to Inez Thayer was only whetted
to a greater degree of constancy by the opposition
it received from its particular object. He was not lacking
in education, having spent four years in the freshman
class at Harvard; he was not unattractive, in his
own individual way, and his one great desire, not even
second to his striving for blue ribbons with his fine stable
of blooded horses, was to have her accept the position of
head of his household.</p>

<p>But Inez was repelled by the very subserviency of his
devotion. Her love rested heavily upon respect, and
this could be won only by a man who commanded it.
John Armstrong fulfilled her ideal, and she wondered
why Fate had not fashioned the man whom she had
attracted in a similar mould.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Armstrong looked up from his reverie half guiltily,
and for a moment his eyes met those of his companion
squarely. Inez could not match the frank glance&mdash;it
seemed to her as if he must have read her thoughts;
but the heartiness of his words relieved her apprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a bore you must think me, Miss Thayer! I
have not spoken a word since we left the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must assume my share of responsibility for the
silence,&rdquo; Inez replied, regaining her composure. &ldquo;The
seriousness of our quest must have had a sobering effect
upon us both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t find these old fellows so serious as
you think,&rdquo; Armstrong hastened to say. &ldquo;They were
humanists and products of the movement which marked
the breaking away from the ascetic severity preceding
them. But, after all, they were the first to realize that
life could be even better worth living if it contained
beauty and happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see how little I know about them, in spite of
Helen&rsquo;s attempt to place me on a pedestal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, if it had not been for their work,&rdquo; he continued,
enthusiastically, &ldquo;the classics might still have
remained as dead to us as they were to those who lived
in the thirteenth century. Instead of studying Virgil
and Homer, we should have been brought up on theological
literature and the &lsquo;Holy Fathers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel just as I did at my coming-out party,&rdquo; Inez
replied&mdash;&ldquo;that same feeling of awe and uncertainty.
I am eager to go with you, yet I dread it somehow. It
is not a presentiment exactly,&mdash;it is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know just what you mean,&rdquo; Armstrong interrupted,
sympathetically; &ldquo;and, if you feel like that now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
just wait until you see old <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, the librarian. It is
he who is responsible for my passion for this sort of
thing. Why, I remember, when I was here years ago
and used to run in to see him at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Laurenziana</span>, I
never regarded him as a mortal at all; and I don&rsquo;t believe
my reverence and veneration for the old man have
abated a whit in the twelve years gone by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The light vehicle had passed through the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Porta alla
Croce</span>, and was swaying from side to side like a ship
at sea, rattling over the stones of the narrow city
streets at such a rate that conversation was no longer
a pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just why Florentine cabmen are content to drive
at a snail&rsquo;s pace on a good road and feel impelled to
rush at breakneck speed over bad ones is a phase of
Italian character explained neither by Baedeker nor by
Hare,&rdquo; remarked Armstrong, leaning nearer to Inez to
make himself heard.</p>

<p>With a loud snap of his whip and a guttural &ldquo;Whee-oop,&rdquo;
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cocchiere</i> rounded the statue of John of the
Black Bands, just missed the ancient book-stand immortalized
by Browning in the <span class="name">Ring and the Book</span>,
and came to a sudden stop before the unpretentious entrance
to the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Biblioteca Laurenziana</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been here before, of course?&rdquo; he asked his
companion as they passed through the wicket-gate into
the ancient cloisters of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Lorenzo</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once, with Baedeker to tell me to go on, and with
the tall Italian custodian to stop me when I reached the
red velvet rope stretched across the room, which I suppose
marks the Dante division between Purgatory and
Paradise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time you shall not only enter Paradise, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
you shall behold the Beatific Vision,&rdquo; laughed Armstrong.</p>

<p>Passing by the main entrance of the library at the
head of the stone stairs, Armstrong led the way
along the upper cloister to a small door, where he pressed
a little electric button&mdash;an accessory not included
in <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span>&rsquo;s original plans for the building. A
moment later they heard the sound of descending footsteps,
and presently a bearded face looked out at them
through the small grated window. The inspection was
evidently satisfactory, for the heavy iron bar on the
inside was released and the door opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maritelli</span>,&rdquo; said Armstrong in Italian.
&ldquo;Is the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">direttore</i> disengaged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is in his study, signore, awaiting your arrival.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maritelli</span> dropped the iron bar back into place with
a loud clang and then led the way up the short flight
of stone steps to the librarian&rsquo;s study. Armstrong detained
Inez a moment at the top.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought you in this way because I want you to
see <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> in his frame. It is a picture worthy the
brush of an old master.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maritelli</span> knocked gently on the door and placed his
ear against it to hear the response. Then he opened
it quietly and bowed as Armstrong and his companion
entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Buon&rsquo; giorno, padre</span>.&rdquo; Armstrong gravely saluted
the old man as he looked up. &ldquo;I have brought to you
another seeker after the gold in your treasure-house.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s face showed genuine delight as he rose and
extended both hands to Inez. &ldquo;Your wife!&rdquo; he exclaimed;
&ldquo;I am glad indeed to greet her.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Armstrong flushed. &ldquo;No, padre, not my wife, but
her dearest friend, Miss Thayer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man let one arm fall to his side with visible
disappointment, which he vainly sought to conceal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, simply, taking Inez&rsquo; hand
in his own. &ldquo;I have known this dear friend for many
years, and have loved him for the love he gave to my
work. I had hoped to greet his wife here, and to find
that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liter humaniores</i> were to her the elixir of life
that they are to me&mdash;and to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I tell her of my visit she will be eager to come
to you as I have,&rdquo; said Inez, strangely touched by the
keenness of his disappointment. &ldquo;To-day she could not
leave her guests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you first show Miss Thayer the illuminations
and the rarest of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incunabula</span>?&rdquo; asked Armstrong,
eager to change the subject; &ldquo;and then will you let
us come back here to talk with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, my son, with pleasure. What shall
I show her first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That little &lsquo;Book of Hours&rsquo; illuminated by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Francesco
d&rsquo;Antonio</span>, padre.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> pulled up the great bunch of keys suspended
from the end of his girdle and unlocked one of the
drawers in the ancient wooden desk in front of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always wonder how you dare keep so priceless a
treasure in that desk, and why it is not put on exhibition
where visitors may see it,&rdquo; Armstrong queried.</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> laughed quietly. &ldquo;There are many other
treasures, my son, equally precious, as you know well,
scattered about in these desks and drawers, where I alone
can find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you take the risk?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s face showed a gentle craftiness. &ldquo;We are in
Italy, my son. If any one could find these gems, any one
could be librarian&rdquo;&mdash;and the old man chuckled quietly
to himself.</p>

<p>Inez&rsquo; eyes were fastened upon a little purple velvet
case inlaid with jewels. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> opened it carefully, exposing
a small volume similarly bound and similarly
adorned. Armstrong eagerly watched the interest in
the girl&rsquo;s face as the full splendor of the masterpiece impressed
itself upon her&mdash;the marvellous delicacy of design,
the gorgeousness of color, the magnificence of the
decoration and the miniatures. Inez drew in her breath
excitedly and bent nearer to the magnifying-glass which
it was necessary to use in tracing the intricacy of the
work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; she cried, and then was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It belonged to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lorenzo</span> the Magnificent, and represents
the finest of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">quattrocento</i> work, my daughter,&rdquo;
explained the old man, pleased as was Armstrong by her
unfeigned admiration. &ldquo;The patrons of the book in
the fifteenth century considered gems of thought as the
most precious of all jewels. The page containing them
must be written upon the finest and the rarest parchment.
They could not inlay costly stones, so they employed
the most famous artists to place upon the page
in beaten gold and gorgeous colors a representation of
the jewels and miniatures as perfect as art at its highest
could produce. Can you wonder, my daughter, that
men brought up in the school of neo-Platonism should
look upon the invention of printing as an evil and an
innovation to be opposed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez would not permit <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> to close the volume until
she had feasted her eyes upon every page.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you not prepared me for an anti-climax?&rdquo;
she asked, with a sigh, as Armstrong suggested a visit
to the room of illuminations. &ldquo;Surely there is nothing
else here to surpass what I have just seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The librarian answered. &ldquo;Nothing to surpass it,
truly, but other volumes equally interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man led them into a larger room filled with
wooden cases whose glass tops were covered with faded
green curtains. Costly tapestries lined the walls, but
Inez&rsquo; attention was quickly taken from them as <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>
pulled aside the curtains and disclosed the resplendent
wealth beneath. Heavy choir-books, classic manuscripts,
books of hours, breviaries embellished by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lorenzo Monaco</span>,
master of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fra Angelico</span>, by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Benozzo Gozzoli</span>, whose
frescos still make the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Riccardi</span> famous, and other artists
whose names have long since been forgotten, but
whose work remains as an everlasting monument to a
departed art. Magnificent examples of every school,
from the early Byzantine to the decadent style of the
sixteenth century, combined to teach the present the omnipotence
of the past.</p>

<p>From case to case they passed, their guide indicating
the variations and the significance of the different
schools, out into the great library itself, in which, with
its noble yet simple proportions as laid down by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span>,
Inez found a relief after the gorgeousness and
grandeur of the last hour. Armstrong pointed out to
her the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">plutei</i> upon which the great books rested, and to
which they now remained chained as in the olden days,
four centuries back, when they began their eternal vigil.
Life outside the old walls had changed mightily since
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici</span>, the first grand-duke, laid their
foundations. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cosimo</span>, &ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pater patri</i>,&rdquo; the real founder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of the collection, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pietro</span> and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici</span> had
come and gone; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lorenzo il Magnifico</span> had lived and
died, bequeathing to them his illustrious name; Charles
VIII. of France had destroyed the power of the house
of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Medici</span>, the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Medici</span> had again regained their own,
the house of Lorraine had succeeded them, the separate
states had been merged into a great kingdom&mdash;and still
the volumes held their places at the end of their chains,
as if to prove the immutability of learning as compared
with the changeability of princes.</p>

<p>At Armstrong&rsquo;s suggestion, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> led them back into
his study, where the old man again took his place at
his desk, as his visitors seated themselves where they
could best watch him and listen to his words. It was,
indeed, as Armstrong had expressed it, a picture for an
old master. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> was clad in the black silk soutane of
his learned order, with the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">biretta</i> upon his head. He
was spare, and the skin upon his face and hands was as
dried and colored as the ancient parchment of the books
with which he lived. The dim light coming through
the stained-glass window enhanced the weirdness of his
aspect, and as one looked he seemed the personification
of the ancient written manuscript vivified and speaking
the words which one would have expected to read
upon the page.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; he was saying to Inez, &ldquo;you, too,
are a humanist, as my young friend and I are, or you
could not manifest so true an understanding as you do.
For humanism, my daughter, is not only the love of antiquity:
it is the worship of it&mdash;a worship carried so
far that it is not limited to adoration alone, but which
forces one to reproduce. By the same token the humanist
is the man who not only knows intimately the ancients
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>and is inspired by them: it is he who is so fascinated
by their magic spell that he copies them, imitates
them, rehearses their lessons, adopts their models and
their methods, their examples and their gods, their spirit
and their tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">SLOWLY THE SPELL BEGAN TO WORK UPON INEZ&rsquo;
BRAIN. SHE WAS NO LONGER IN THE PRESENT&mdash;SHE
WAS A WOMAN OF ITALY OF FOUR CENTURIES BACK</span>
</div>

<p>Then <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> passed on in his conversation to the old-time
writers themselves. The little study was poorly
ventilated, and the air was heavy. The ancient tomes
exuded their peculiar odor, and the low, sing-song voice
of the speaker seemed far removed from the life they
had just left outside. Slowly the spell began to work
upon Inez&rsquo; brain. She was no longer in the present&mdash;she
was a woman of Italy of four centuries back.
Petrarch, with his laurel-crowned head, rose up before
her and recited verses written for Laura; Politian gave
to her of his wisdom; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Machiavelli</span> discussed Florentine
politics with her. It was not the voice of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> the
librarian which she heard&mdash;it was the veritable voice
from the dead and buried past. She furtively glanced
at Armstrong and saw in his face a light which she
knew Helen had never seen there, and in her heart she
felt a guilty joyousness at the advantage she had gained.
It was <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Leonardo</span> sitting at the old desk now&mdash;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Leonardo</span>
the master of art, of sculpture, the forerunner, the man-god
against the god-man. She pressed her hand to her
head; it was dripping moisture. Would he never stop?
It was becoming fearsome, unbearable. Her eyes were
fixed upon the aged priestly clad figure before her;
she could not move them. What power held her, what
magic controlled even her thoughts? She tried to speak
to Armstrong, to tell him that she was ill, but her mouth
seemed parched and she could not speak. She looked
at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s chair again. The old man was no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
there. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Machiavelli</span> had taken his place and was uttering
diatribes against the state. She must cry out&mdash;she could
not. She started to her feet&mdash;then she fell back, and
all became a blank. When she revived, a few moments
later, it was in the sunny enclosure of the cloister garden,
whither Armstrong had anxiously carried her, and
where the fresh air served to relieve the tension and to
counteract the influence which had so overpowered her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>V</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>By mutual consent, Miss Thayer and Armstrong
decided not to mention the rather dramatic finale
to their first excursion to the library. Inez experienced
the deepest mortification, while Jack blamed himself
severely that he had not watched his companion
more carefully. If he had done this, he repeated to himself,
he might easily have anticipated and avoided the
unpleasant climax to an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable
morning. Miss Thayer, however, would not listen to his
apologies: he had accepted her as a comrade, and she
had proved herself unequal to the test. Armstrong
tried to reassure her, but his efforts were not eminently
successful.</p>

<p>The whole affair, in spite of their disclaimers, made a
considerable impression upon them both. Armstrong
knew that it had not been weakness alone; for even his
brief acquaintance with her told him that strength was
a salient point in her character. She was impressionable&mdash;he
realized that&mdash;but surely not to the extent of
losing all control over herself. Was it&mdash;and Armstrong
feared lest Inez should read his mind as the thought
came to him&mdash;was it that same irresistible influence of
those ancient spirits, coming out from the past to her
as they had so many times to him, recognizing her as a
reincarnation of themselves, and claiming her, even for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that, brief moment of unconsciousness, as a part of what
had gone before?</p>

<p>Inez pleaded a headache upon reaching the villa,
and asked that her lunch be sent to her room; but
it was long after <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span> had left the tray upon
the table that she was able to taste, even sparingly,
the tempting delicacies which were placed before her.
What can be more searching than a woman&rsquo;s self-examination?
She had told Armstrong that she blamed
herself for her weakness; so she did, but it was not
wholly the weakness of losing consciousness. Who was
this man, and what this influence which had so suddenly
entered into her life and assumed such immediate control
over her? She felt that she could resist either separately,
but together they produced a power which she
questioned her ability to oppose. And the strange part
of it all was that no one was forcing it upon her. She
knew perfectly well that she need never go to the library
again unless she chose; but she knew equally well what
her choice must inevitably be, if the opportunity were
offered her.</p>

<p>Even as she recalled her experience, a thrill half of
delight, half of apprehension, passed over her. What
did it all mean? Armstrong compelled her respect, but
it was ridiculous even to wonder whether or not the
sentiments he inspired were of a more serious nature.
The subjects in which he was interested appealed to her
highest self and fascinated her, but beyond this what
possible force could they possess to render her so immediately
subservient to their demands? What was
there about it all which made it seem so inexpressively
delicious? And what of him, of this man above whose
head the ancients had already placed the halo of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
approval, who stood to her as the personification of ideal
manhood?</p>

<p>These were some of the questions Inez Thayer asked
herself that afternoon, wrestling within and striving
honestly to decide her course; but even as she did so
she found her thoughts again centering themselves upon
Armstrong as she closed her eyes and allowed herself
to be carried back to the experiences of the morning.
She had no reasonable excuse to leave Florence, which
instinctively she felt to be the safest thing to do; and,
besides this, her spirit revolted at the thought that she
could not meet the problem face to face and master it.
She must do it, she would do it; and, having finally arrived
at this determination, she came down, just before
dinner, and joined her friends in the garden, where
they were enjoying the soft close of the perfect Italian
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; Helen welcomed her with outstretched
arms. &ldquo;Is your headache better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; Inez replied, forcing a smile;
&ldquo;the air was very close in the library, and then, too, I
found so much to make me thoughtful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you were not disappointed?&rdquo; Emory asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disappointed? It was wonderful. You don&rsquo;t know
how much you all missed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look as if Jack had shown you some spooks,&rdquo;
remarked Eustis; &ldquo;you are as white as one yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The color quickly returned to Inez&rsquo; face. &ldquo;I am
always like that when I have one of these wretched headaches,&rdquo;
she explained. &ldquo;But, truly, I never had such
a remarkable experience. I can quite understand Mr.
Armstrong&rsquo;s devotion. I never knew before how fascinating
such learning really is.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he actually conjure up those old fellows and put
them through their paces for you?&rdquo; Emory asked.</p>

<p>Miss Thayer was in no mood for bantering. &ldquo;It is
not possible for you to understand without experiencing
it yourself,&rdquo; she said, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or even afterward, I suspect,&rdquo; Bertha Sinclair
added, slyly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad that you enjoyed it,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t get much out of Jack, and I was afraid that
you had passed a stupid morning and that the headache
was the natural result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never forget it&mdash;never!&rdquo; Inez murmured.</p>

<p>Helen regarded her attentively for a moment. &ldquo;I
had no idea it would make so strong an impression on
you,&rdquo; she said at length. &ldquo;Now that it is over, you and
Jack will both feel better satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must see <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, Helen, and let him show you
those wonderful books and explain everything, just as
he did to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I will, sometime,&rdquo; Helen smiled. &ldquo;Perhaps he
could bring out my dormant possibilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time we dressed for dinner,&rdquo; remarked Mary
Sinclair, rising. &ldquo;You and Inez are already <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en grande
tenue</i>, but the rest of us are shockingly unconventional.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the Sinclair girls hurried into the house, closely
followed by the men, Helen leaned against the balustrade
at the end of the bowling-green and watched the deepening
color which touched alike the spires of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santa
Croce</span> and the turret of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Vecchio</span>, gleamed
on the dome of the Cathedral and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giotto</span>&rsquo;s tower, and
spread like wine over the placid surface of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arno</span>.
Beyond the river rose the basilica of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Miniato</span>, its
ancient pediment sharply outlined against the sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Helen&rsquo;s thoughts wandered even farther away than her
eyes. Inez watched her for several moments before slipping
her arm about her waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Inez!&rdquo; Helen was startled for an instant.
&ldquo;Did you ever see such a wonderful spot as this?&rdquo;
she continued, recovering herself. &ldquo;Some new beauty
discloses itself uninvited hour by hour. Every time I
come into the garden I find some lovely flower I never
saw before, or meet some sweet odor which makes me
shut my eyes and just draw it in with delight. Each
time I look toward Florence the view is different, and
each new view more beautiful than the last. Oh, Inez
darling, is it an enchanted palace that Jack has brought
me to, or is it just because I am so blissfully, supremely,
foolishly happy?&rdquo; Helen embraced her friend enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us call it the enchanted palace, dear,&rdquo; Inez
answered as Helen released her, &ldquo;and you the modern
Circe, with power to make all about you as beautiful
and as happy as the ancient Circe to cast malign influences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen laughed. &ldquo;Why not take it further and say
that the transformation of the ancient Circe is the final
triumph of Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s labors? Had his theories
been in force among the friends of Ulysses, the fair
lady could never have turned them into swine. But
tell me, did you not find Jack a very different person
from what you had expected after seeing him here at
home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, indeed,&rdquo; assented Inez, soberly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he not simply splendid?&rdquo; Helen&rsquo;s face beamed
with pride. &ldquo;It was just as much of a surprise to me.
Of course, I have always known that he was interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in all these things, but it has only been since we were
married that I have realized how much he actually
knows.&mdash;I wish I thought there was even the slightest
chance of his being able to lead me up to his heights,
he is so eager for it. I shall give him an opportunity
to try his experiment, of course, but the
trouble is that in spite of the interest and fascination
which I do feel, his hobby always seems to me to be
hemmed in with needless limitations. For my part, I
don&rsquo;t see why we can&rsquo;t take the best these master spirits
of the past can give us, just as Jack says, but without
ourselves becoming a part of the past.&mdash;You see how
absolutely hopeless I am. I wonder how in the world he
ever came to be attracted to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the only one who wonders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that my hair is not red, and that I
don&rsquo;t squint, and all that, but Jack is so fascinated by
everything scholarly that I don&rsquo;t see why he didn&rsquo;t
select an intellectual wife. Why, I don&rsquo;t even wear
glasses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez smiled at the picture Helen drew. &ldquo;The rest
of us girls understand why he made just the selection
he did, Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never wanted to be intellectual before. Until now
I have always considered the caricatures of the Boston
Browning woman as typical of the highly educated
species; but you are showing me that a girl can be human
and intellectual at the same time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could show you that you make too much
of a mountain out of this intellectual bugbear,&rdquo; Inez
replied, candidly. &ldquo;Your husband is a very unusual
man. His interest in the humanities is beyond anything
one can appreciate without seeing him as I saw him this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
morning. He longs to take you with him into this life,
and if I were in your place I should let him be the one
to discover my lack of understanding, if I really did
lack it, instead of insisting upon it as a foregone conclusion.
For myself, I don&rsquo;t take much stock in it. I
remember too well how quick a certain Miss Cartwright
was at school to grasp new ideas, and I have not noticed
any serious retrogression since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen pondered carefully over her friend&rsquo;s criticism
before replying. &ldquo;I suppose it does seem like obstinacy,&rdquo;
she said, finally&mdash;&ldquo;to him as well as to you;
yet to myself it appears perfectly consistent. The one
thing which gives me an idea of the extent of his devotion
is my music. You know how I adore it, how
much a part of my life it has always been&mdash;yet it means
nothing to Jack, and he therefore takes no particular
interest in it. He went to the Symphonies and the
Opera with me while we were engaged, and to concerts
and recitals, but I knew all the time that it was just to
please me. I made up my mind that when we were married
I would keep up my interest in this &lsquo;devotion&rsquo; of
mine only as much as I could without having it interfere
with those things which he cared for or which we
could enjoy together. But the fact that music means
less to him than it means to me does not make me love
him any the less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t enter into this particular interest of
his, even to please him, as he did to please you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I appreciate from the experience I have
just mentioned how little real satisfaction it would give
either one of us. Looking back, I feel that I was positively
selfish to let him go to those concerts with me, and
I shall never inflict them on him again. I am sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
he knows how I feel, and I think he ought to be grateful
for my consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez pressed Helen&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You ought to know
best, dear,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You both possess such
wonderful possibilities that it would be a shame not to
combine them. It seems to me that you might come to
an appreciation of each other&rsquo;s interests by becoming
familiar with them.&mdash;I wonder if you realize what a man
your husband is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen leaned over and kissed her impulsively. &ldquo;I
realize more than I ever intend to let him know, dear
child. He would become unbearably conceited were he
even to guess how much he has already become to me.
I really did not want to marry him&mdash;or to marry any
one&mdash;but he swept away every objection, just as he
always does, and now I find myself wondering how
in the world I ever existed without him. Oh, Inez&rdquo;&mdash;Helen&rsquo;s
face became tense in her earnestness&mdash;&ldquo;we girls
think we know a whole lot about marriage. We anticipate
it&mdash;we dread it; but, when one actually enters
into her new estate, she knows how infinitely more it is
to be anticipated, if happy, than her fondest dream.
But if unhappy&mdash;then her dread must have been infinitesimal
compared with the reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Marriage is either a complete union or a complete
isolation,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Inez.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I tell you, Jack and I understand each other
perfectly,&rdquo; Helen continued, confidently, &ldquo;and that
means so much to a girl. One of the first things I told
him, after we became engaged, was that if our affection
stood for anything it must stand for everything. If
at any time while we were engaged, or even after we
were married, he felt that he had made a mistake in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
thinking me the one woman in the world for him, he was
to come to me frankly and say so, and together we would
plan how best to meet the situation. Suppose, for instance,
that Jack met some one whom he really loved better
than me. It would be an awful experience, but how
much less of a tragedy to recognize the fact than to live
on, a hollow, miserable existence, such as we see in so
many instances around us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he has not confessed to you yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Helen laughed, &ldquo;and we shall have been
married six weeks to-morrow. That is a pretty good
start, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how about yourself&mdash;have you the same privilege?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course; but that is not important, for I shall
never see any one fit to ride in the same automobile with
Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say about my automobile? Has it
arrived?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s face was filled with eager expectation as
he came up behind Helen, followed by Uncle Peabody.
He drew her affectionately toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wretch!&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;you have been eavesdropping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not an eavesdrop,&rdquo; protested Jack, &ldquo;and I can
prove it by a witness. When I came down-stairs I
looked for my beloved spouse upon the terrace and
found her not. The gentle <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span> confided to me that
you and the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Signorina</span> Thayer were in the garden; I
set out upon my quest and found you here discussing
my automobile or some one else&rsquo;s. Again I ask you,
have you news of its arrival?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jack&mdash;no news as yet; and you make out so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
good a case that I must absolve you. Since you insist
on knowing, we were discussing the very prosaic subject
of matrimony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why discourage Miss Thayer from making the attempt
simply because of your own sad case?&rdquo; Armstrong
queried, releasing his wife and seating himself
beside her on the edge of the balustrade. &ldquo;Marriage
is a lottery&mdash;so saith the philosopher. We all know
the preponderance of blanks and small prizes, yet each
one feels certain that he will be the lucky one. Once in
a while a chap pulls out the capital prize, and that encourages
the others, though it ought to discourage them,
because it lessens the chances just so much. But what
I object to is the growling afterward, when each should
realize that he is getting exactly what he ought to have
expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is not fair that both you and Helen should
have drawn the lucky numbers,&rdquo; Inez declared. &ldquo;It
makes it so hopeless for the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Sir Fisher,&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;you have gained
the compliment for which you strove. Art satisfied?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one has drawn me yet,&rdquo; suggested Uncle Peabody,
&ldquo;and I am a capital prize&mdash;I admit it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a shame to throw cold water on Miss Thayer&rsquo;s
beautiful sentiment,&rdquo; continued Armstrong. &ldquo;Such
thoughts are so rare that they should be encouraged;
but the facts of the case are that the capital prizes
in the men&rsquo;s lottery were discontinued long ago. No&mdash;among
the girls they are still to be won at rare intervals,
but the only way to distinguish the men is by looking up
their rating in Bradstreet&rsquo;s, or their mother&rsquo;s family
name in the Social Register. Other than this, one man
is as bad as another, if not worse.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Inez looked at Armstrong for a moment with a puzzled
expression, but failed to find any suggestion that
he was speaking lightly. And yet&mdash;what a change in
attitude from the morning! She hesitated to turn the
subject upon what seemed to her to be forbidden ground,
yet she could not resist opposing his expressions, even
though they might be uttered flippantly. Her voice contained
a reproach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke differently of men this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong turned to her quickly. &ldquo;This morning?&rdquo;
he repeated. &ldquo;Oh, but I was referring to the humanists,
and to ancient ones at that. I am talking now of
men in general, rather than of those rare exceptions,
ancient or modern, who have succeeded in separating
themselves from their commonplace contemporaries. Of
course, my respect for the old-timers is supreme, because
their great accomplishments were in the face of
so much greater obstacles. Since then the world has
had five hundred years in which to degenerate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to him, Inez,&rdquo; Helen interrupted,
complacently. &ldquo;He is simply trying to start
an argument, and he does not believe a word he says.
He really looks upon men as infinitely superior beings
in the past, present, and future, and this self-abnegation
on the part of himself and his sex is only a passing conceit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I refuse to be side-tracked,&rdquo; Armstrong insisted. &ldquo;I
grant that the conversation started more in jest than
in earnest, but I maintain my position, none the less.
Modern civilization has brought to us a wonderful
material development, but intellectual advance, instead
of keeping abreast of the material, has positively retrograded.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You really make me feel ashamed to be living in
such an abominable age,&rdquo; suggested Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>Inez was serious. &ldquo;I am quite incompetent to carry
on this discussion with you, Mr. Armstrong,&rdquo; she said,
disregarding the others, &ldquo;and I admire, as you know,
the marvellous accomplishments of these &lsquo;old-timers,&rsquo;
as you call them, wondering at their power to overcome
the obstacles which we know existed. Yet I like to
believe that the ages which have passed have marked
an advance on all sides rather than a retrogression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So should I like to,&rdquo; assented Armstrong, &ldquo;if I
could; but look at the facts. William James has just
succeeded in making philosophy popular, but Plato and
Aristotle gave it to us before the birth of Christ. We
enthuse over Shakespeare and Dante and Milton, but
Homer and Virgil gave us the grandest of poetry two
thousand years ago. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">quattrocento</i>, that period
which so fires me with enthusiasm, gave us <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Raphael</span>
as an artist, together with <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Leonardo</span> and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span>
as the foremost examples of humanists. Whom have we
had since to equal them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this is beyond argument,&rdquo; Inez admitted. &ldquo;But
is this the fault of the men or of the times? Conditions
are so changed that the same kind of work can never
be done again. The telephone, the telegraph, railroad
trains, fast steamships, the daily papers&mdash;everything
distracts the modern worker from devoting himself
wholly and absolutely to his single purpose; but with
this distraction is it not also true that the modern worker
gives to the world what the world really needs most under
the present conditions? In other words, would not
these same great men, if set down in the twentieth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
produce work very similar to what modern great
men have given and are giving us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be sorry enough to think so,&rdquo; affirmed
Jack. &ldquo;What a pity it would be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s mood had changed from amusement
to interest. &ldquo;If I really thought you were sincere in
the attitude you take,&rdquo; he said, addressing Armstrong,
&ldquo;I could prescribe no better cure for your complaint
than to force you to subject yourself, for one single
week, to those same conditions which you seem to admire
so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you refer to conveniences, Mr. Cartwright,&rdquo; interrupted
Armstrong, &ldquo;I will admit without argument
that you are right. These are wholly the result of material
development.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us confine ourselves to intellectual achievements
if you choose,&rdquo; continued Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;Without
an intellect, could one harness steam and electricity and
make them obedient to the human will? Is not a wireless
message an echo from the brain? What is the telephone
if not a product of thought?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and Miss Thayer are arguing my case far better
than I can do it myself,&rdquo; replied Armstrong, undisturbed.
&ldquo;The triumphs of Watt and Edison and
Marconi and Bell are all intellectual, even though utilitarian.
Each of these men has proved himself humanistic,
in that he has given to the world the best that is
in him, and not simply modified or readapted some previous
achievement. If they were not limited by living
in an age of specialization they might even have been
humanists. Right here in Italy you see the same thing
to-day. The Italians are beyond any other race intellectually
fit to rule the world now as they once did, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
it is simply because they have been unable to withstand
materialism that they have not reclaimed their own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean by &lsquo;humanism,&rsquo; Jack?&rdquo;
Helen asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The final definition of modern humanism will not
be written for several years,&rdquo; Armstrong answered.
&ldquo;The world is not yet ready for it, and I am afraid
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s creed of ancient humanism would strike you as
being rather heavy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see if I could comprehend it.&rdquo; Helen looked
across to Inez, and the eyes of the two girls met with
mutual understanding. &ldquo;Can you repeat it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it word for word,&rdquo; her husband replied,
eagerly, delighted to have Helen manifest an interest.
&ldquo;It was the first lesson the old man taught me, years
ago. &lsquo;The humanist,&rsquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> says, &lsquo;is the man who
not only knows intimately the ancients and is inspired
by them: it is he who is so fascinated by their magic
spell that he copies them, imitates them, rehearses their
lessons, adopts their models and their methods, their examples
and their gods, their spirit and their tongue.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was visibly disappointed. &ldquo;I thought I had
an idea,&rdquo; she said, slowly, &ldquo;but I was wrong. Inez
used the word &lsquo;humanities&rsquo; a few moments ago, and I
once heard President Eliot say that this was simply another
name for a liberal education&mdash;teaching men to
drink in the inspiration of all the ages and to seek to
make their age the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not wrong, Helen,&rdquo; continued Armstrong,
&ldquo;unless you understand President Eliot to mean that the
ages which have come since these great men lived have
been able to add particularly to what has gone before.
All that is included in what <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> says.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the present, which I love so well, means nothing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means a great deal.&rdquo; Armstrong laughed at the
injured tone of Helen&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;The great material
achievements of the present, which you just heard cited
by Miss Thayer and Uncle Peabody, are of vast importance,
but the age does not stand out as a period of intellectual
progression. The achievements themselves,
and the new conditions which they introduce, make that
impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we not admire the past and enjoy what it has
given us without becoming a part of it ourselves?&rdquo; persisted
Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if we remain true to our ideals. I spoke just
now of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Leonardo</span> and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span> as being the foremost
examples of humanists. By that I mean that they
represent the highest point of intellectual manhood. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Da
Vinci</span> was a great writer, a great painter, a great scientist,
a great engineer, a great mechanician, while
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Buonarroti</span> was famous not only as a sculptor, but
also as a painter, an architect, and a poet. And these
men had to develop their own precedent, while all
who have striven for more than mediocrity since then
have propped themselves up on the work of these and
other great masters. Can you wonder that my own
great ambition, quite impossible of accomplishment, is
to emulate these men&mdash;not in the same pursuits, but in
some way, in any way, which enables me to give to the
world the best that is in me. Should I gratify myself
in this, that which I accomplished would be done simply
in the fulfilment of my effort, and I should gain my
recompense in the knowledge that it <em>was</em> my best. This
is my understanding of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s creed.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All this is most interesting,&rdquo; admitted Helen. &ldquo;It
is indeed splendid to know the ancients intimately, and
to receive their inspiration. It is fine to imitate them
and to rehearse their lessons, but I don&rsquo;t see why we
should bind ourselves down to the old-time limitations
by using their methods when, to my mind, our own
methods are so much better suited to modern conditions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your position is fully justified, Helen, if you really
believe these methods to be limitations,&rdquo; replied Armstrong,
seriously. &ldquo;For my part, I do not feel this. I
accept the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> creed without qualification. I grant
you that many things of the past are limitations, but
there are certain cardinal principles which must remain
the same so long as the world lasts and which are not
subject to what you call &lsquo;modern conditions.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be wholly consistent, Jack,&rdquo; pursued Uncle Peabody,
&ldquo;should you not adopt their tongue&mdash;as called
for in the creed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily, as the &lsquo;creed&rsquo; is, of course, idealistic;
but the only reason I do not do so is because of
the limitations which are placed upon us&mdash;this time by
modern civilization. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> and I converse for hours
together in the Latin tongue, but it is very seldom that
I find the opportunity to do this. Why is it that Latin
is used in medicine, in botany, in science, to give names
to various specimens or species? Simply because French,
German, Italian, English may be forgotten languages
a few centuries hence, but Latin&mdash;the so-called dead
language&mdash;will be as enduring then as now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can never hope to become as much of an enthusiast
as you, Mr. Armstrong,&rdquo; Inez said, finally, as the
others gave up the argument in despair; &ldquo;and I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
you will never forgive me if I say that I fear it
would be very uncomfortable for me if I did. You
must simply let me browse around the edges as a neophyte
while you and the master quaff the nectar and
ambrosia of the gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I cannot even do that,&rdquo; added Helen, rising
from the balustrade. &ldquo;I cannot give up my dear present
even to agree with my learned husband. You don&rsquo;t
want me to say that I am sorry I am living among all
these imperfect conditions when I really find them very
satisfactory and enjoyable? It is wrong of you so to
break down my modern idols. There are our guests,&rdquo;
she continued, as a laughing group appeared on the
veranda. &ldquo;As penance I decree that you shall take
each of us by the hand and lead us back to the villa&mdash;the
Humanist flanked by the Pagan and the Christian.
Arise, thou ancient one, and lead us on!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>VI</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>The visits which Armstrong and Miss Thayer
made to the library became of daily occurrence.
Encouraged by his companion&rsquo;s interest, and the
eagerness with which she assimilated the enthusiasm
which he and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> were only too willing to share with
her, Armstrong promptly embraced a scheme for definite
work suggested to him by the librarian. Inez at first
proved only a sympathetic spectator, but by the third or
fourth day she found herself a distinct part of the
working force. She demurred half-heartedly, but when
it became evident that she could really make herself of
service she entered into it with characteristic intensity
which increased from day to day.</p>

<p>Soon after the departure of the guests the automobile
arrived, and transformed Armstrong from a
Humanist into an Egoist and then into a Mechanist.
For the moment the material concern took precedence
over the intellectual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I expect to have the chauffeur do the
work once we are under way,&rdquo; he half apologized to
Uncle Peabody, who with a good-natured interest watched
him taking the precious machine to pieces; &ldquo;but before
I trust it to any one I must understand it thoroughly
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right, quite right,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody assented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
cheerfully. &ldquo;I believe in that theory entirely. I have
noticed when my friends have found themselves stalled
on the road that it never annoys them half so much
if they can explain the reason why. Besides, from a
secondary consideration, I suppose it adds something to
the safety to know the machine yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the car had arrived in advance of the chauffeur,
Armstrong had plenty of time to study the mechanism.
It came to pieces with consummate ease. Its new
owner had never claimed much knowledge along these
lines, but the simplicity of this particular machine increased
his respect for his judgment as a purchaser and
his natural though hitherto undeveloped ability as a mechanic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These Frenchmen,&rdquo; he confided enthusiastically to
Uncle Peabody, &ldquo;have the rest of the world beaten to
a stand-still in building automobiles. My hat is off to
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you not be even more comfortable if you removed
your shirt as well?&rdquo; suggested Uncle Peabody,
mischievously, as he glanced sympathetically at Armstrong&rsquo;s
face, from which the perspiration rolled down
onto his collar in response to his unusual exertions and
the heat of the full Italian sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nearly to pieces now,&rdquo; Armstrong replied, complacently.
&ldquo;I will wait until it is cooler before I set it
up again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>True to his word, Armstrong began work on the
restoration early next morning, but the heat of the day
found him still at his labors and in no cheerful frame of
mind. Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s philosophical suggestions had
proved unacceptable some hours before. Helen&rsquo;s remark
that she did not believe the three extra pieces Jack held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
despairingly in his hand had come from that particular
machine at all brought forth such a withering expression
of pitying contempt that she flew back to the house in
alarm. Even the servants found that the opposite side
of the villa demanded their especial care. A truce was
declared for the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">colazione</i>, but Armstrong devoured his
repast in silence, showing no interest in the animated
conversation, and with scant apologies left the table long
in advance of the others to resume his task.</p>

<p>At five o&rsquo;clock a dusty <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vettura</i> drove noisily into the
driveway, and from his point of vantage, lying on his
back underneath the automobile, Armstrong saw Mr.
Ferdinand De Peyster alight. With a curse muttered,
not from any antipathy to his visitor, but simply on
general principles, he laboriously extricated himself from
his position with a view to the extension of hospitality.
De Peyster saw the movement and hastily approached.</p>

<p>Ferdinand De Peyster was a distinct individuality,
which in a degree explained the criticism which some
of his friends passed upon him. His foreign descent,
though now tempered by two generations of American
influence, was probably responsible for the fact that he
was &ldquo;different from other men.&rdquo; Always faultlessly
dressed, his taste followed the continental styles rather
than those which other men about him were in the habit
of adopting, so while Americans in Florence were clad in
flannels, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nglig</i> shirts, and white buckskins, De Peyster
appeared at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span> immaculate in the
conventional lounging-coat, tucked shirt and lavender
gloves, with white spats over his patent-leather shoes.
There was more of a contrast between visitor and guest
at that moment than Armstrong realized as he emerged
in his old clothes, thoroughly soaked through with perspiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and with his hands and face grimy with oil
and dirt.</p>

<p>De Peyster drew back instinctively as the full vision
of Jack&rsquo;s figure presented itself. &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comprenez vous
franais</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong stopped in his advance as he heard the
question and noted the superior tone in which it was
delivered. Then the humor of the situation appealed
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he replied, respectfully, &ldquo;or English, if
you prefer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Peyster&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;Ah! Mr. Armstrong
brought you over with him?&rdquo; he remarked, becoming almost
sociable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Jack replied, truthfully. &ldquo;Is there anything
I can do for you, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Mr. De Peyster,&rdquo; said Ferdinand, with condescension&mdash;&ldquo;a
friend of your master&rsquo;s in America. Is
he at home this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Armstrong could continue De Peyster approached
nearer to him and lowered his voice. &ldquo;I say&mdash;is
there a Miss Thayer from America visiting here
just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A quick movement on De Peyster&rsquo;s part deposited a
franc in Jack&rsquo;s grimy palm. Holding his hand in front
of him, his astonished look alternated between the piece
of silver and his friend&rsquo;s face until he found himself
unable to keep up the farce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;De Peyster, you are a fraud!&rdquo; Armstrong laughed
boisterously at the look of dismay in Ferdinand&rsquo;s face
as a realization came to him. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell
me that the joys of a honeymoon and life in Italy have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
wrought so many changes that you don&rsquo;t recognize
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can you blame me?&rdquo; De Peyster joined in the
merriment. &ldquo;Run and get some one to tell you how you
look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of this unexpected hilarity reached the
terrace, and Uncle Peabody, flanked by both of the girls,
came rushing out fearful lest Jack&rsquo;s problem had resulted
in temporary mental derangement. A glance at
the picture before them, however, explained the situation
better than words, and Helen hurried forward to greet
her visitor while Inez followed behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ferdy De Peyster&mdash;in the flesh!&rdquo; cried Helen.
&ldquo;What does this mean, and when did you reach Florence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong gave him no opportunity to reply. &ldquo;He
prefers to speak French, Helen, and he is just throwing
his money around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then turning to De Peyster and exhibiting his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pourboire</i>,
he repeated, &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comprenez vous franais</span>?&rdquo; while
both men went off again into a paroxysm of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the joke?&rdquo; Helen asked, looking from one
to the other completely mystified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a good one&mdash;and on me,&rdquo; replied De Peyster.
&ldquo;I took him for the chauffeur, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked at her husband. &ldquo;Is it safe for me to
laugh now, Jack?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I am glad something
has happened to put you in good-humor. Can you be
induced to leave your work for the rest of the day and
make yourself presentable to join us in the garden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong cast a despairing glance at the machine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall be fresher in the morning,
anyway, and I am sure I can fix it up then.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like knowing all about it yourself, Jack,&rdquo;
Uncle Peabody remarked, innocently. &ldquo;These French
machines are so simple!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take the girls back to the garden,&rdquo; Armstrong
replied, emphatically, &ldquo;and kindly devote your attention
to your own theories, or I will put you at work on the
blamed thing yourself to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Peyster greeted Inez effusively, paying but little
attention to Helen and Uncle Peabody as they strolled
back to the garden, while Jack disappeared in-doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; he exclaimed as they reached the balustrade.
&ldquo;How did Armstrong happen to find a place
like this? Is it not simply splendid, Inez?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez Thayer resented something&mdash;she did not quite
know what. She had been expecting De Peyster&rsquo;s arrival
daily, yet now that he had come she was still unprepared.
She could find no fault with his attentions
except that they had been too assiduous. Perhaps it was
that, try as she could, she had been quite unable to convince
him that his devotion was useless. He accepted
each rebuff philosophically and bided his time.</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span> skilfully arranged the chairs and laid the
little table, placed, as Helen had taught her, in a spot
commanding the exquisite view of the valley and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San
Miniato</span> beyond. Luscious <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fragole</i>, cooling <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">gelati</i>, seducing
little Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">paste</i>, as only Helen&rsquo;s cook could
make them, and a refreshing <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Asti</span> cup replaced the tea
which the girls had decided would be less acceptable on
this particular day; and by the time all was in readiness
Armstrong joined them clothed in his proper mind and
raiment.</p>

<p>The conversation turned upon the voyage across.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had an awfully jolly crowd on board,&rdquo; said De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Peyster. &ldquo;There were Emory and Eustis, who you say
have just left you, and then there were three charming
married women who insisted on my playing bridge with
them every afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did not have to insist very hard, did they,
Ferdy?&rdquo; interrupted Helen&mdash;&ldquo;with your reputation for
gallantry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ferdinand smiled complacently. &ldquo;Making up a
fourth at bridge comes under the definition of &lsquo;first
aid to the wounded,&rsquo;&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I did not object
at all to being the doctor. Their conversation was
so clever, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clever conversation always helps good bridge,&rdquo;
Armstrong interrupted, dryly; but De Peyster was already
deep in his story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One afternoon they had a discussion as to how large
an allowance for personal expenses would make each one
perfectly happy,&mdash;funny subject, wasn&rsquo;t it? Well, one
of them said ten thousand a year would take care of her
troubles nicely; the second one was more modest and
thought five thousand would do,&mdash;but what do you think
my partner said? She was a demure little lady from
Chicago and had only been married a year and a half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep us in suspense, Ferdy,&rdquo; said Helen, as
De Peyster yielded to the humor of his recollections.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, it was awfully funny,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;She
looked rather frightened when the conversation began,
and when they urged her to set a price she said, &lsquo;I
would be perfectly satisfied if I could afford to spend
just what I am spending.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had a conscience&mdash;that is the only difference between
her and the other women,&rdquo; Armstrong commented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; added Helen; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll guarantee that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
another year she will be getting a divorce from her husband
on the ground of incompatibility of income.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then in the evenings,&rdquo; De Peyster went on, &ldquo;the
men got together in the smoke-room, but I think we
drank too much. I always felt uncomfortable when I
got up next morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another encouragement for my <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum opus!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed
Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;I am going to invent a wine
possessing such qualities that the more one drinks of it
the better he will feel next morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you succeed you will have clubdom at your feet,&rdquo;
Armstrong replied, while De Peyster feelingly nodded
assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mind if I invited Inez to drive with me
to-morrow, Helen?&rdquo; ventured Ferdinand, abruptly, looking
anxiously at Miss Thayer. &ldquo;I know you honeymooners
won&rsquo;t mind being left alone if I can persuade
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means, Ferdy&mdash;unless Inez has some other
plans. Jack has been making her ride his hobby ever
since she arrived, and I have no doubt she will be glad
enough to escape us for a little breathing-spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you put it that way I shall certainly decline&rdquo;&mdash;Inez
failed to show any great enthusiasm&mdash;&ldquo;but otherwise
I shall be very glad to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack intends to put his automobile together to-morrow,&rdquo;
Uncle Peabody remarked, &ldquo;so it will be just as
well not to have any one outside the family within hearing
distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong tried to wither Uncle Peabody with a
glance, but ran up against a smiling face so beaming
with good-nature that even real anger would have been
dispelled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For Helen&rsquo;s sake&mdash;&rdquo; Jack began, but Uncle Peabody
interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Helen&rsquo;s sake you will hasten the arrival of your
chauffeur, if such a thing be possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="r3">The following day was an eventful one. First of all,
as if in response to Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s exhortation, the
chauffeur appeared. Mr. Cartwright departed for the
city soon after breakfast, to be gone all day, and by
the time the heat of the afternoon had subsided De
Peyster drove up in state to enforce the promise Inez
had given him the afternoon before. After watching
them drive away, Helen slipped her hand through her
husband&rsquo;s arm and gently drew him with her into the
garden. They walked in silence, Helen&rsquo;s head resting
against his shoulder, until they reached her favorite
vantage-spot, when she paused and looked smilingly into
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack dear,&rdquo; she said, quietly, &ldquo;do you realize that
this is almost the first time we have really been by ourselves
since we took that walk to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But at least you have had an opportunity to show
your villa to your friends!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke, Jack&mdash;I am not in the mood for it this
afternoon. I don&rsquo;t know why, but I have been feeling
very serious these last few days. Tell me, dear&mdash;are you
perfectly happy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong looked surprised. &ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;perfectly
happy. What a curious notion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it is, but humor me just this once. Are
you as fond of me now as you were that day at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You silly child!&rdquo; Jack drew her to him and kissed
her. &ldquo;Whatever has possessed you to-day?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but you see I measure everything by
that day at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span>. I believe it was the happiest day
I ever spent. Since then, somehow, I have felt that we
were not so near together. Of course, you have been
away a good deal at the library and looking up things
with Inez, which was just what I wanted you to do;
and then we have had a good many here to entertain,
which was also what I wanted; but I can&rsquo;t help feeling
that you have not found here at home just what you
should have found to make you perfectly happy. Tell
me, dear, have I been to blame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong paused as if weighing something heavily
in his mind. &ldquo;Perhaps I have no right to go on with
this work,&rdquo; he remarked, at length, &ldquo;but the only way
to stop it would be to leave Florence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t mean that, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t. I am speaking simply for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was again silent, and Helen hesitated to break in
upon his reverie. He seemed for the moment to be far
away from her, and she felt an intangible barrier between
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not make any one understand.&rdquo; Armstrong
was speaking more to himself than to her. &ldquo;Ever since
I left Florence years ago I have felt something pulling
me back, and ever since I have been here I have been
under influences which I can explain no more than I can
resist. It must be this, if anything, that you feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; Helen hastened to reassure
him. &ldquo;Sometimes when I have been playing something
on the piano I have the strangest sensation come over
me. I seem to lose my own individuality and to be
merged into another&rsquo;s. I feel impelled to play on, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
an unspeakable dread comes over me lest some one should
try to stop me. Is it not something like that which you
feel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Armstrong, &ldquo;only a thousand times
stronger than any one could put in words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know exactly what you mean&mdash;and there is nothing
for which you need blame yourself. You warned
me before we left Boston that you had left here a second
personality. I know that you confidently expected your
own enthusiasm to excite my interest when once in the
atmosphere. I wish that it had, dear, but I fear I am
hopelessly modern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong looked at his wife intently, yet he gave
no evidence that he had heard her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have started on a great task at the library, Helen.
The spirit of work is on me, and I feel that I have a
chance to prove myself one of that glorious company.
I may find myself unequal to the opportunity, but if we
stay here in Florence I cannot keep away from it. If
my absence from you makes you unhappy I must separate
myself from these associations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;I would not have you
stop your work for worlds. Even though I am unable
to appreciate it, you know how interested I am in anything
which adds to your happiness&mdash;and I am so proud
of you, dear! That was one reason why I was glad that
Inez could spend a little time with us. She, at least, can
help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can indeed,&rdquo; replied Armstrong, frankly, &ldquo;and
she has already. I have never seen a girl with such
natural intellectual gifts. Her arguments are so logical,
her reasoning so clear, that I find even her disagreements
most entertaining. What a pity she is not a man!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you would like her,&rdquo; answered Helen.
&ldquo;Sometimes I think you ought to have married a girl
like her instead of me, but&rdquo;&mdash;Helen looked at him
smilingly and drew closer to him&mdash;&ldquo;but I am awfully
glad that you didn&rsquo;t, Jack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What nonsense, Helen!&rdquo; cried Armstrong, coming to
himself and drawing her to him. &ldquo;Who is fishing now?
I would ask no better chum than your charming, brown-eyed
friend, but I am quite content that I possess as
wife this sweet girl here in my arms who is trying to
find a cloud in this cloudless sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Jack.&rdquo; Helen straightened up reproachfully.
&ldquo;But I like to hear you say these things&mdash;just
as you did that day at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span>! And even if I should
find a cloud it would be sure to have a silver lining,
wouldn&rsquo;t it, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong smiled. &ldquo;Yes, sweetheart, and, as Uncle
Peabody says, &lsquo;all you would have to do would be to
turn it around lining side out.&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>VII</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>Inez Thayer found herself overwhelmed by a varied
mingling of conflicting emotions as she settled
herself in the victoria, and listened without remark to
the enthusiastic and joyous monologue to which her companion
gave free rein. She felt herself absolutely helpless,
borne along resistlessly like a rudderless ship by a
force which she could neither control nor fully comprehend.
She still longed for a valid excuse to leave Florence,
yet in her heart she questioned whether she would
now be strong enough to embrace the opportunity even
if it came. She had dreaded the certain appearance of
De Peyster, yet she had been eager to enter into the
inevitable final discussion so that the episode might be
closed forever. She said to herself that she hated Armstrong
for the mastery which he unconsciously possessed
over her, yet every thought of him thrilled her with a
delight which nothing in her life had before given her.
The color came to her cheeks even now, and De Peyster,
watching her intently, thought it was in response to his
own remark and felt encouraged.</p>

<p>The drive took them, as a matter of course, to the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cascine</span>, where fashionable Florence parades up and
down the delightful avenues formed by the pines and
the ilexes. On this particular afternoon the heat encouraged
them to take refuge on the shadier side toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the mountains, reserving the drive along the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arno</span> until
the brilliant coloring of the setting sun should show
them both <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bellosguardo</span> and the city itself in their fullest
glory. De Peyster was intoxicated by the enjoyment
of his environment, and seemed quite content to accept
his companion&rsquo;s passive submission to his mood. At
length his exuberance of spirits became mildly contagious,
and Inez threw off her apprehensions and forgot
the dangers and perplexities which she felt surrounded
her.</p>

<p>But her feeling of security was short-lived. De Peyster
no sooner became conscious of her change of manner
than he seized it as a long-awaited opportunity. Beginning
where he had left off at the last attack, he rehearsed
the history of his affection from the day he had
first met her until the present moment. For the first time
Inez experienced a sympathy toward him rather than a
sorrow for herself. He was, even with his limitations, so
deadly in earnest, his devotion was so unquestionable, his
very persistency was so unlike his other characteristics,
seeming a part of a stronger personality, that it forced
her admiration. And yet how far below the standard
she had set!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not believed me, Ferdinand, when I have
told you over and over again that what you ask is absolutely
impossible.&rdquo; Inez spoke kindly but very firmly.
&ldquo;I truly wish it might be otherwise, but it is
kinder that I make you understand it now instead of
having this unhappiness for us both continue indefinitely.
I know you mean every word, but I say to you now
finally and irrevocably&mdash;it can never be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Peyster looked into her face searchingly. &ldquo;You
never said it like that before, Inez.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have&mdash;not once, but many times, and in almost
the same words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is not the words that count, Inez. I don&rsquo;t
care how many times you say it in the way you always
have said it before. I expected to hear it again. But
this tone, Inez, this manner is quite different; and for
the first time I have a feeling that perhaps you do mean
it after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do mean it, and I have meant it every time I have
said it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez was relentless, but she felt that this was the one
time when matters could be finally settled, and the carriage
had already begun the climb to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Settignano</span>.</p>

<p>De Peyster still gazed at her with uncertainty. Then
a sudden light came to him and showed in his face,
mingling with the evident pain which the thought
brought him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; he said, bending toward her to watch her
expression more intently; &ldquo;I have it. You are in love
with some one else!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez felt her face burn with the suddenness of the
accusation. She hesitated, and in that moment&rsquo;s hesitation
De Peyster had his answer. Still he was not satisfied.
He must hear the words spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told me last time that there was no one else,&rdquo;
he said, reproachfully, &ldquo;and I know you spoke the
truth. Now there must be some one, and if there is I
am entitled to know it. So long as my love for you
cannot harm you, no power on earth can take it away
from me; but if there is another who has a better right
than I, that is a different matter. Tell me, Inez&mdash;I insist&mdash;do
you love some one else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no retreat. Any denial of words would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
useless, and it was the only way to end things after all.
She lifted her eyes to his and spoke calmly, though the
color had fled from her cheeks and her face was deathly
pale. &ldquo;Yes, Ferdinand, you are entitled to know it. I do
love some one else, and I love him better than my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; De Peyster exclaimed, dejectedly.</p>

<p>There was a long pause, during which he struggled
bravely with himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me who it is,&rdquo; he said, at length. &ldquo;Of course,
this makes it different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez could not help admiring the unexpected strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Ferdinand, I cannot. This is my secret, and
you must not question further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it must be some one here, for you told me just
before you sailed that there was no one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps here&mdash;perhaps elsewhere. You must leave
it there, Ferdinand. If you care for me, as you say you
do, I ask you to leave it there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Peyster bowed submissively and shared her evident
desire for silence during the few moments which remained
of their drive.</p>

<p>Helen and Jack met them at the villa, and were greatly
disappointed that Ferdinand declined their pressing
invitation to stay for supper in the garden. A promise
that he would take tea with them on the following afternoon
was all they could secure from him, and when
Inez rushed up-stairs promptly upon his departure Jack
looked at Helen meaningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have turned him down good and hard this
time, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Ferdy!&rdquo; Helen replied, sympathetically. &ldquo;I
had no idea he could get so cut up over anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p class="r3">The automobile, even in the two days it had been a
member of the Armstrong family, completely demoralized
the entire establishment. Jack was beside himself with
excitement and joy, his early experiments both with
chauffeur and car being eminently satisfactory. He contented
himself with short runs down to the city and
back the first day after his man had succeeded in putting
the car into its normal condition, but his impatience
to start out again immediately after each return, even
though luncheon was most unceremoniously shortened,
produced almost as much dismay in the household as his
bad temper while trying to reconstruct the machine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you all to have a ride in it at the earliest
possible moment,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;but before I risk
any one&rsquo;s neck but my own I must satisfy myself that
the car is all right and that the chauffeur knows his
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only event which diverted Armstrong was the return
to the villa of Inez and De Peyster, for their evident
discomforture caused him real concern. On general
principles he was interested in the outcome of the
obvious errand which had brought De Peyster to Florence,
and beyond this he had already come to look upon
Miss Thayer as a most agreeable companion and assistant
whose happiness and equilibrium he regretted to
see disturbed.</p>

<p>After De Peyster&rsquo;s unceremonious departure and
Inez&rsquo; abrupt disappearance, he and Helen strolled out
into the garden, where the table was already laid for
supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no use waiting for Inez,&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;Poor child! It is a shame to have her unhappy when
we are so contented. But where is Uncle Peabody?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I met him on the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lung&rsquo; Arno</span> and offered to take
him home, but he said he was bound for Olschki&rsquo;s. Trying
to find out if <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Luigi Cornaro</span> wrote anything he had
not discovered, he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he will come before we have finished. You
sit there, Jack, where you can watch the sunset behind
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Miniato</span>, and I will sit next to you so that I can
watch it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen drew the light chair nearer, and smilingly looked
up at him. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is this not cozy&mdash;just
you and I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong smiled back into her radiant eyes with
equal contentment. &ldquo;This is absolute perfection, but
you don&rsquo;t imagine we can eat like this, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel a bit hungry,&rdquo; she replied, cheerfully,
making no attempt to move. &ldquo;Uncle Peabody says we
ought not to eat when we don&rsquo;t feel like it, and I don&rsquo;t
feel like it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what does Uncle Peabody say about not eating
when you have been knocking about in an automobile all
day and have the appetite of a horse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you men!&rdquo; cried Helen, straightening up with
a pout. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there is a bit of sentiment in
a man&rsquo;s make-up, anyhow. Eat&mdash;eat&mdash;eat&mdash;&rdquo; and she
piled his plate high with generous portions from every
dish within reach.</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s step upon the path gave warning of
his approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I am in time after all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was afraid
I should be obliged to eat my evening repast in solitary
loneliness. But is this the way you follow my precepts?&rdquo;
he continued, as his eye fell upon Armstrong&rsquo;s plate.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you take it on the instalment plan&mdash;or are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
anticipating forming a partnership with a stomach-pump?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my fault, uncle,&rdquo; replied Helen, contritely.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make Jack romantic, so I tried to stuff him to
keep him good-natured. That is always the next best
thing with a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh ho!&rdquo; Uncle Peabody looked shocked as he drew
a chair up to the little table. &ldquo;So I have come right
into a family quarrel, have I? Naughty, naughty, both
of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could quarrel with him,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;but
he is too agreeable, even in his aggravating moods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you to say to that pretty speech, John
Armstrong?&rdquo; asked Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can I say?&rdquo; answered Jack, between mouth-fuls,
&ldquo;except that, speaking for myself, I am always
much more romantic when I am not hungry. If Herself
will indulge me for five minutes longer I will promise
to be as sentimental as the most fastidious could desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care for manufactured sentiment,&rdquo; replied
Helen; &ldquo;and it is too late now anyway, for my own
appetite has returned and my anger is appeased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Thayer evidently has not returned yet?&rdquo; ventured
Uncle Peabody, interrogatively, as the supper progressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is up-stairs in tears, and Ferdy has gone
away to throw himself into the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arno</span>,&rdquo; Helen replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, dear me!&rdquo; murmured Uncle Peabody.
&ldquo;What a pity! I am not sure that I would have returned
had I known that I should find so much trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that you have had this much, I think I will
let you in for the rest,&rdquo; suggested Armstrong. &ldquo;I will
take you out to the garage after you have finished.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;More trouble there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;punctured a tire on the way up the hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you never said a word about it!&rdquo; cried Helen.
&ldquo;No wonder you did not feel romantic!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Peace is once more established, which is
worth more than a new tire. Come, my appetite is satisfied&mdash;suppose
we all go out to the garage.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span> interrupted their progress at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gentleman to see the signora,&rdquo; she announced&mdash;&ldquo;the
same gentleman who took the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Signorina</span> Thayer to
ride this afternoon&mdash;and would the signora see him
alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Ferdy,&rdquo; Helen sighed, aloud. &ldquo;He wants me
to intercede for him. You go on, Jack, and perhaps I
may join you later. Show Mr. De Peyster out here,
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ferdinand hardly waited to be ushered through the
hallway. He was visibly suffering as he approached
Helen with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry, Ferdy,&rdquo; was all she could say before
he interrupted her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Helen, for coming to you before I have
regained control of myself; but I have made a sudden
decision, and unless I carry it out at once I won&rsquo;t be able
to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sudden decision, Ferdy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am leaving Florence on the night train for
Paris; but I could not go without seeing you again and
leaving with you a message for&mdash;Inez.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The night train to-night? Surely you are not going
away without seeing Inez again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s sympathy was strong in the face of his almost
uncontrollable emotion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to-night, Helen; and I shall never see her again
unless she sends for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what has happened to make things so hopeless
now? She has refused you before, Ferdy, and I have
always admired your pluck that you refused to give her
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is different now&mdash;there is a reason why I must
give her up. There was none before, except that she
did not think she cared for me. I was certain I could
make her do that&mdash;in time. But now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; Her interest was sincere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must know, Helen. Why do you pretend that
you don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean? I am not pretending. I
know of nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Peyster was incredulous. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Helen.
We men would do the same thing, I suppose, to protect
another chap&rsquo;s secret; but it is pretty rough on me,
just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s mystification was complete. &ldquo;Look here,
Ferdy,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;this has gone too far. Inez has
evidently confided to you something which she has never
told me. I have not had a word with her since she returned,
and I know nothing of what has happened except
what I have surmised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that Inez has been here all
this time as your guest without your knowing that she
has fallen in love with some one over here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inez in love! Ferdy, you are crazy! Who is it,
and where did she meet him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;she would not tell me, but it is some
one she has met over here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. She must have said it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to make you understand that she could not marry
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ferdinand shook his head. &ldquo;No. A girl could fool
me on some things, I suppose; but when she speaks as
Inez spoke she means every word she says. &lsquo;I do love
some one else,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and I love him better than my
life.&rsquo; Do you think Inez would say that if she did not
mean it, Helen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen leaned against the arm of the settle. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
understand it, Ferdy&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do, and I am not strong enough to see her
again or to stay here in Florence. I will not trouble her
again unless she sends for me&mdash;anything sent in care
of Coutts will always reach me. Or after she is married,
and I am myself again, I would like to see her and congratulate&mdash;him.
Forgive me, Helen, I am all unstrung
to-night. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Peyster was gone before Helen realized it. She
sank upon the settle and rested her face on her hand.
Inez in love, and with some one she had met in
Italy! Who was it&mdash;when was it? She had come directly
to the villa upon her arrival. She had said
that she had met no one who interested her on the
steamer. In Florence she had met no one otherwise than
casually. All her time had been spent either with her
or with Jack. Helen lifted her head suddenly. &ldquo;With
Jack,&rdquo; she repeated to herself. She rose quickly and
looked off into the distance. The last bright rays were
disappearing behind <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Miniato</span>. &ldquo;I love him better
than my life,&rdquo; Inez had said to Ferdinand. Helen
grasped the railing of the balustrade for support.
&ldquo;With Jack!&rdquo; she repeated again. &ldquo;Oh no, no, no&mdash;not
that!&rdquo; she cried aloud&mdash;&ldquo;not that!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>&ldquo;How is the work at the library progressing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen asked her husband at breakfast a few
mornings later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Famously,&rdquo; Armstrong replied, pleased that she had
referred to the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it nearly finished?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finished?&rdquo; Jack laughed indulgently. &ldquo;You evidently
don&rsquo;t realize what a big thing I have undertaken.
I find myself appalled by its possibilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Uncle Peabody looked up surprised.
&ldquo;Does this mean that you are likely to lengthen your
stay in Florence beyond your original plans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think not,&rdquo; Armstrong replied. &ldquo;We have
been here less than a month now, and I ought to be able
to put my material into shape during the two months
which remain&mdash;especially with the splendid assistance
Miss Thayer is giving me. I can add the finishing
touches after we return home, if necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it take as long as that?&rdquo; asked Helen, her color
mounting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you are not counting upon me for any such
length of time!&rdquo; exclaimed Inez, almost in the same
breath. &ldquo;My cousins are expecting me to join them in
Berlin any day now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would not desert your post of duty?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I must follow the direction toward which it points.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what is this &lsquo;big thing&rsquo; you have undertaken?&rdquo;
interrupted Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;You forget that I have
not yet been taken into your confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong turned to his questioner seriously. &ldquo;I
have really stumbled upon something which has not been
done before and which ought to have been undertaken
long ago. You see, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> has there at the library hundreds
of letters which belong to the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Buonarroti</span> archives.
Many of them were written by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span>, and many
more were written to him. The correspondence is between
him and men in all walks of life&mdash;popes, kings,
princes, tradesmen, and even some from the workmen in
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carrara</span> quarries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you and Miss Thayer are translating these letters?&rdquo;
Uncle Peabody anticipated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but that is not the work which most interests
me, except indirectly. Any number of volumes have
been published upon the life and manners and customs
of every age before and since that in which <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span>
lived, yet practically nothing concerning this particular
period. The artistic importance of the epoch has been
written up with minute detail, but the intimate life of
the people and its significance seems to have been
wholly overlooked&mdash;probably because it was overshadowed.
Very few of these letters have ever been printed,
and they ought to form the basis of a great work upon
this subject. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> has turned them over to me to see
what I can do with them. At first I started with the
idea of going through everything myself, but that would
be a hopeless task unless we plan to live in Florence indefinitely.
Now, Miss Thayer reads over the letters and
takes out the important data, leaving me free to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
on the book itself. We are really making splendid
progress, and I shall be bitterly disappointed if Miss
Thayer has to go away and leave me to finish it alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure Inez will stay as long as she can, Jack,&rdquo;
Helen said, quietly. &ldquo;She knows how welcome she has
been, but we must not urge her beyond what she thinks
is best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly; then, with an assumed nonchalance,
said: &ldquo;I wonder if I could not help in some
way and thus get the work completed just that much
sooner. Of course, I don&rsquo;t understand Italian, but perhaps
I could do some copying or something. Don&rsquo;t you
think three would accomplish more than two, Jack, even
if one of them was a weak sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked over to her husband with obvious expectancy,
but she could not fail to notice the momentary
hush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know how ridiculous my proposition sounds,&rdquo; she
continued, bravely, &ldquo;but I would really like to try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; Armstrong replied, hastily.
&ldquo;Miss Thayer&rsquo;s suggestion to leave and your willingness
at last to come to my rescue have combined to give me
two unexpected shocks&mdash;one unpleasant, the other delightful.
Let me see. Miss Thayer and I have been
developing a kind of team work, so this means a little readjustment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, if it is not perfectly convenient.&rdquo;
Helen made an effort to appear indifferent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is convenient,&rdquo; Jack hastened to add,
ashamed of his hesitation. &ldquo;You know how much I have
wanted you to do this, and I am perfectly delighted. I
am sure it can be arranged and that you can help us a
great deal.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you knew Italian, Helen, so that you could
take my place,&rdquo; added Inez. &ldquo;Then Mr. Armstrong
would not accuse me of deserting my post of duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; protested Armstrong, impulsively.
&ldquo;Even then I could not get along without your assistance.
We can easily find something for Helen to do
which will help the work along and encourage her in
her budding enthusiasm. This is splendid! Helen interested
at last in my dusty old divinities! Perhaps we
can even infect Uncle Peabody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; assented Uncle Peabody; &ldquo;but for the
present I shall devote myself to my own researches&mdash;even
though your masterpiece is forced to suffer thereby.
But I will ride down with you as far as the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Duomo</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one in the automobile, unless it was the chauffeur,
could help feeling a certain tenseness in the situation as
the car conveyed the party to its destination. Helen&rsquo;s
action was the result of a sudden decision, quite at variance
with all the conclusions at which she had arrived
during the wakeful hours of the preceding nights. Armstrong
had so long since given up all thought of having
his wife co-operate with him in this particular expression
of himself, and the work upon which he and Miss Thayer
were engaged had settled down into so regular a routine,
that he was really disturbed by Helen&rsquo;s change of base,
although he had been entirely unwilling to admit it.
Inez inwardly resented the intrusion, at the same time
blaming herself severely for her attitude; and Uncle
Peabody, who saw in the whole affair only a clever ruse
on Helen&rsquo;s part instigated by a tardily aroused jealousy,
was in danger, for the first time, of not knowing just
what to do.</p>

<p>As a result of all these conflicting emotions, the efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
at conversation during the ride would have seemed ludicrous
had the situation been less serious. Armstrong
kept up a continuous and irrelevant conversation into
which each of the others joined weakly with equal irrelevance.
Each was trying to talk and think at the
same time. The car reached the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza del Duomo</span> almost
abruptly, as it seemed, and Uncle Peabody alighted with
considerable alacrity, waving a good-bye which was mechanically
acknowledged as the machine slowly moved
into the narrow <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Borgo San Lorenzo</span>. At the library,
Armstrong led the way through the cloister and up the
stone stairs to the little door where <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maritelli</span> was this
time waiting to give them entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take you to meet <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>,&rdquo; said Armstrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I,&rdquo; interrupted Inez, &ldquo;will seek out our table
and get all in readiness for our triple labors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A gentle voice called &ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Avanti</span>,&rdquo; in answer to Jack&rsquo;s
tap upon the door of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s study, and the old man
rose hastily as he saw a new figure by Armstrong&rsquo;s
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife, padre.&rdquo; Jack smiled at the admiration in
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s face as he took Helen&rsquo;s hand and raised it to
his lips. &ldquo;She could not longer resist the magnet which
draws us to you and to your treasures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wife,&rdquo; repeated the old man, looking from
Helen to Armstrong. &ldquo;I have looked forward to this
day when I might meet her here. But where is your
sister-worker? Surely she has not given up the splendid
task which she has so well begun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen flushed consciously at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s praise of Inez.
&ldquo;No, father; Miss Thayer is already at her work, and
Mr. Armstrong is equally eager to return to it. May
I not stay a little while with you?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you time to show her some of the things here
which we know and love so well?&rdquo; asked Armstrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to Helen. &ldquo;If you will accept my guidance
we can let these humanists resume their labors
while we enjoy the accomplishments of those who have
gone before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong left them, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> conducted Helen
through the library, explaining to her the various objects
of interest. It was quite apparent to Helen that the
old man was studying her minutely, and she felt ill at
ease in spite of his unfailing courtesy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have known my husband for a long while, have
you not?&rdquo; Helen asked as they passed from one case to
another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed&mdash;even before he came to know himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must know him very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen smiled, but the old man was serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better than you know him, even though you are
his wife. But see this choir-book. It was illuminated
by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lorenzo Monaco</span>, teacher of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fra Angelico</span>. Can anything
be more wonderful than these miniatures, in the
beauty of their line and color?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen assented with a show of interest, but she was
not thinking of the blazoned page before her. The old
man&rsquo;s words were burning in her heart. Passing through
a smaller room to reach <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s study, they came suddenly
to a corner lighted only by a small window where
Armstrong and Inez were at work. So intent were they
that the approach of Helen and the librarian had not
been noticed. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> held up his hand warningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; he commanded, softly. &ldquo;Let us not disturb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
them. I have never seen two individualities cast in
so identical a mould. One sometimes sees it in two men,
but rarely in a man and a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen felt her breath come faster as she watched them
for a moment longer. Inez was pointing out something
in the text of the original letter which lay before them.
Armstrong&rsquo;s head was bent, studying it intently. Then
Inez spoke, and her companion answered loud enough
for Helen to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid! And to think that we are the first ones
to put these facts together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The expression of sheer joy upon her husband&rsquo;s face
held Helen spellbound, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> was obliged to repeat
his suggestion that they return to his study by another
route.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just as you have seen it, day after day,&rdquo; said
the librarian as he closed the door quietly, and Helen
seated herself in the Savonarola chair beside his desk.
&ldquo;When I heard from him that he was to be married I
hoped that his wife might be able to enter into this joy
of his life; but, since that could not be, it is well that
he has found a friend so sympathetic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen told herself that the old man could not intend
deliberately to wound her as he was doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so sure that his wife cannot enter into
it also?&rdquo; she asked, quietly.</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> looked at her in evident surprise. &ldquo;Because
what I have seen during these weeks, and what you have
seen to-day, can happen but once in a lifetime. You
are more beautiful than his companion, but you are not
so intellectual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was impossible to take offence at the old man&rsquo;s
frankness because of his absolute sincerity. He spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of her beauty exactly as he spoke of one of the magnificent
bindings he had just shown her, and of Inez&rsquo;
intellectuality as if it were the content of one of his
priceless tomes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to the library to-day for the definite purpose
of joining in their work&mdash;&rdquo; Helen began, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely not!&rdquo; replied <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, emphatically. &ldquo;You
would not disturb these labors which mean so much in
the development of them both? It would mean stopping
them where they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could I not assist them at some point, even to a
slight extent, and participate in this development myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> was mildly indulgent at her lack of understanding.
&ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; he said, kindly, &ldquo;some one
has written that it is no kindness to a spider, no matter
how gentle the touch, to aid it in the spinning of its
web. Any one can work at translating, truly&mdash;almost
any one can write a book&mdash;but few can accomplish what
your husband and Miss Thayer are doing now. The
book they are engaged upon in itself is the least of
value. They do not themselves realize, as I do, that
it is the influence of this work upon their own characters
which is making it a success. They were humanists
before they knew the meaning of the word. They come
into the highest expression of themselves here in this
atmosphere. You were born for other things, my daughter&mdash;perhaps
far more important things&mdash;but not for
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot understand, father,&rdquo; Helen replied,
desperately. &ldquo;I am his wife, and it is my place, rather
than that of any other woman, to share with him any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
development which affects his life as deeply as you say
this does. It must be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me if I offend you, but this is not a matter
which you or I can settle. It is perhaps natural that
I cannot understand your viewpoint. The nature of
my life and work gives me little knowledge of women;
but this is not a question of sex&mdash;it is the kinship of intellects.
You are his wife, and, as you say, it is your
privilege to share with your husband any development,
but it must be along a path which you are able to tread.
I mean this in no unkind way, my daughter. I doubt
not that you, perhaps, in all other ways, are quite capable
of doing so, but this one single portion of his life
it is quite impossible that you should share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen had no response. Her heart told her that all
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> said was literally true. She felt herself to be absolutely
unfitted to understand or to supplement that
particular expression of her husband&rsquo;s character. But
the matter-of-fact suggestion of the librarian that Inez
should fulfil to him that which she, his wife, lacked, almost
paralyzed her power to think or speak. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> seemed instinctively
to read what was passing through her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think me unreal, my daughter&mdash;you think me
impractical. I may be both. Here, within these old
walls, I am not limited by the world&rsquo;s conventions, so
perhaps I disregard them more than is right. Those
whom I love signify nothing to me as to their personal
appearance or their families or their personalities except
in so far as these attributes may be expressions of
themselves. Life to me would not be worth the living
if in debating whether or not I ought to do a certain
thing I was obliged to consider also what the world
would think or what some other person might think.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Let me ask you a question: Was your motive in coming
here this morning the result of a desire to put yourself
in touch with the spirit of your husband&rsquo;s work, or was
it to separate these two persons in the labor they have
undertaken?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s question brought Helen to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are really free from the world&rsquo;s conventions,&rdquo;
she responded, quickly, &ldquo;you will understand my answer.
My husband is everything to me that a wife could ask,
and his happiness is the highest object my life contains.
Miss Thayer is the dearest friend I have, and my affection
for her is second only to the love I bear my husband.
While this side of his nature was not unknown
to me, until we came to Florence&mdash;even until to-day&mdash;I
have never fully appreciated its intensity. Yet when I
feel that to a certain extent, at least, his welfare depends
upon a gratification of this expression, is it unnatural
that I, his wife, should wish to be the one person to experience
that development with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not feel this strong desire when you first
came to Florence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would your present comprehension have come at all
if his companion had been a man rather than a woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen flushed. &ldquo;You are not so free from the world&rsquo;s
conventions as you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you do not answer the question,&rdquo; the old man
pursued, relentlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think, then, that my desire is prompted by
jealousy? Let us speak frankly,&rdquo; continued Helen as
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> held up his hand deprecatingly. &ldquo;The distinction
in my own mind may be a fine one and difficult for another
to comprehend, but I can say truly that no jealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
thought has entered into any of my considerations. I
could not love my husband and be jealous of him at the
same time. On the other hand, it is probably quite true
that were his companion a man I should not have recognized
so strongly the importance of joining him in this
particular work.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> rose quietly, and took from the bookcase near
his desk a copy of a modern classic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The author has expressed an idea here which I think
explains your position exactly.&rdquo; He turned the pages
quickly. &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said, drawing closer to Helen
and pointing to a paragraph marked with a double score
in the margin. &ldquo;&lsquo;No man objects to the admiration his
wife receives from his friends; it is the woman herself
who makes the trouble.&rsquo; Now I suppose the reverse of
that proposition is equally true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen smiled. &ldquo;You mean that the reason I am not
jealous of my husband in this instance is because he has
given me no occasion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is perfectly true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you fear that it may not always be true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was no match for the old man in argument,
yet she struggled to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;there is always that danger.
Why not avoid it by making this other companionship
unnecessary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose you yourself are not temperamentally
fitted to gratify this particular craving in your husband&rsquo;s
life?&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> watched the effect of his words
upon his companion. She was silent for several moments
before she raised her eyes to his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that you are right,&rdquo; she answered, simply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
&ldquo;I have felt it always, but my husband has insisted that
in my case it was lack of application rather than of
temperament. I came here to-day to try the experiment,
and you have shown me that my own judgment
is correct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is correct,&rdquo; agreed <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, delighted by Helen&rsquo;s
unexpected acquiescence. &ldquo;It was your husband&rsquo;s heart
rather than his head which led him astray in his advice.
You have just shown me your intelligence by coming
so promptly to this conclusion; now you are going
to manifest your devotion to him by leaving him undisturbed
in this work which he has undertaken. It can
only last during a limited period at best. It is the expression
of but one side of his nature. Before many
weeks have passed you and he will be returning to your
great country into a complexity of conditions where this
experience will become only a memory. These conditions
will call to the surface the expression of his other characteristics
into which you can fully enter. By not interfering
with this character-building now going on,
you, his wife, will later reap rich returns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tap sounded on the door of the study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is your husband now,&rdquo; said <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, taking
Helen&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Tell me that you forgive me for my
frankness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen pressed his hand silently as he turned from her
to admit Armstrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; cried Jack, as he entered with Inez.
&ldquo;We became so engrossed that I am ashamed to say I
completely forgot our new convert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your forgetfulness has given me the opportunity to
become well acquainted with your charming wife,&rdquo; replied
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>. &ldquo;Is your work completed for the day?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we shall be at it again to-morrow. You will
come with us of course?&rdquo; he asked, turning to his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not quite sure, Jack,&rdquo; Helen replied. &ldquo;Monsignor
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> has suggested to me another way in which
I can help you, which may prove to be equally important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned to Inez with an unflinching smile. &ldquo;Our
friend has been explaining to me the nature of what you
and Jack are doing together. You must certainly plan
to stay on for a while longer. I am sure Jack could
never finish it without you.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>IX</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>The human heart can play no more difficult rle
than to keep on with its every-day monotonous
pulsations, so far as the world sees, when in reality
every throb is a measured duration of infinite pain. Ten
days had passed since De Peyster had so unconsciously
been the cause of completely changing the even tenor of
Helen&rsquo;s existence, and during this time she had drifted
helplessly in the deep waters of uncertainty. What was
the wise thing to do? Helen knew Inez too well to deceive
herself into thinking that what was said to Ferdinand
had been simply an expedient to accomplish his
dismissal, and her observations since then had confirmed
her early convictions. Inez was in love with Jack. Jack
was obviously fond of her companionship. Their work
in the library had brought them constantly together,
and at home an increasing proportion of the time had
been devoted to a consideration and discussion of the
various topics which had developed and into which Helen
did not enter. Yet there was nothing in all this which
was not perfectly natural; in fact, it was, as Helen said
to herself, wholly the outcome of what she had originally
suggested.</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s convictions regarding Inez were confirmed, not
by what her friend did, but rather by the efforts she
made to avoid doing certain things. Never for an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
did Helen question Inez&rsquo; loyalty to her, and she
could scarcely refrain from entering into the tremendous
struggle in which she saw her engaged. Each woman&rsquo;s
heart was passing through fire, and Helen felt a new and
strange bond of sympathy between her friend and herself
because of their mutual suffering. But the struggle
must continue. Helen must come to some decision wiser
than any which had yet suggested itself to her before
disclosing to any one, and to Inez least of all, that she
possessed any knowledge of the situation.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at this crisis, the automobile became the
controlling excitement. During the intervening days
Jack had resisted the temptation, devoting himself assiduously
to his self-appointed task, and satisfying himself
with short excursions after his labors at the library
were over. Now he could resist no longer. The book
was assuming definite proportions, and, as he explained
to himself and the others, the work would be all the better
for a little holiday. So it was that the Armstrongs,
with Miss Thayer and Uncle Peabody, made runs to
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Siena</span>, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Padua</span>, and to all the smaller towns less frequented
by visitors and consequently of greater interest. Miss
Thayer forgot in the excitement the experience she was
passing through; Uncle Peabody forgot <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Luigi Cornaro</span>
and the Japanese; Armstrong, for the time being, appeared
indifferent to the hitherto compelling interests at
the library; and Helen, at intervals, forgot her suffering
and the heavy burden which lay upon her heart in her
feeling of helplessness. New sensations, in this twentieth
century, are rare, and the automobile is to be credited
with supplying many. The exhilaration, the abandon,
which comes with the utter annihilation of time and
space, forces even those affairs of life which previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
had been thought important to become miserably commonplace.
The danger itself is not the least of the fascination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather be killed once a week in an automobile,&rdquo;
asserted Uncle Peabody while the fever was on
him, &ldquo;than die the one ordinary death allotted to man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the temporary cessation of the library work,
there had been no occasion for separate interests. This,
Helen felt, was most fortunate, as it gave her ample
opportunity to arrive at her conclusions. It was all her
own fault, she repeated to herself over and over again.
Had she made an earlier effort to enter into Jack&rsquo;s interests,
even though it had proved her inability, matters
need never have arrived at so serious a pass. Now
she was convinced that it was too late to become a part
of them; she had done an irreparable injury to Inez,
whom she loved as a sister, and had taken chances on
disrupting her own and her husband&rsquo;s domestic happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Jack said, I have found a cloud in the cloudless
sky,&rdquo; she thought.&mdash;&ldquo;And poor Inez!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the burden resolved itself into two parts&mdash;solicitude
for Inez and how best to undo the harm Helen
felt she had wrought. Her first attempt had proved a
failure, and she could not see the next step. While the
motoring fever lasted there was nothing to do but to
plan; for the excitement was infectious, and one trip
followed another in rapid succession. Household regularity
became conspicuous by its absence. Meals were
served at all hours and were rushed through with reckless
haste, entirely upsetting Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s theories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You treat your stomach like a trunk,&rdquo; he protested
to Armstrong one morning, &ldquo;and you throw the food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
into it just about the way an average man does his packing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you finish your breakfast just as soon as any
of us,&rdquo; was the retort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but if you observe carefully you will note that
I actually eat about one-quarter as much as you do in
the same given time. And what I have eaten will satisfy
me about four times as long, because I have thoroughly
masticated it and assimilated all the nourishing portions
of the food. When I think of the gymnastic performances
your poor stomach must go through in order to
tear into shreds the chunks of food you have bolted down
I admit my sympathy is fully aroused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sympathy is always grateful,&rdquo; Armstrong replied,
unconvinced, &ldquo;but every moment we lose discussing nutrition
is a moment taken off the finest trip we have tried
yet. The car is in splendid condition, the weather is
ideal, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pisa</span> awaits us at the other end of our excursion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is to be <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pisa</span>, is it?&rdquo; Uncle Peabody arose.
&ldquo;Do you know, Jack, I like you for the way you plan
these charming rides, and that almost makes up for your
lack of judgment in some other directions. An ordinary
man would spend at least the day before in studying
maps, asking advice, and in making plans generally.
You, on the contrary, wait until breakfast is over, throw
down your napkin, and then with a proper show of impatience
say, &lsquo;Why do you keep me waiting? The car
is ready to take us to the moon.&rsquo; All this fits in exactly
with my principles: it is the unexpected which always
brings satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle&rsquo;s praise is distinctly a man&rsquo;s approval,&rdquo; Helen
protested. &ldquo;From a woman&rsquo;s standpoint Jack&rsquo;s methods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
represent the acme of tyranny. No inquiries as to where
we prefer to be spirited, no suggestions that our opinions
are worth consulting, no suspicion that we are other than
clay in the potter&rsquo;s hands; simply, &lsquo;The machine is
ready. Please hurry.&rsquo; Yes, we are coming,&rdquo; Helen
hurriedly added, seeing Jack&rsquo;s impatience over the bantering,
&ldquo;we are coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>, and the cook were avowed enemies
of the motor-car, not only because of the effect it had
produced upon the household arrangements, but also because
of the intrusion of the French chauffeur which it
had forced upon them. They would die rather than show
the slightest interest in it, yet on one pretext or another
they never allowed the machine to start out without regarding
it with secret admiration and respect. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>,
on this particular morning, was gathering roses on the
terrace, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span> was closing a shutter on the veranda,
while the cook&rsquo;s red face peered around the corner of the
villa. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> crossed himself as the engine started up,
then jumped and fell squarely into his rose-basket as the
chauffeur maliciously pressed the bulb, and the machine
moved majestically past him, out of the court-yard, and
into the narrow road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame these people for resenting the invasion
of motor-cars and other evidences of modern progress,&rdquo;
said Inez as they reached the level; &ldquo;it is all so out of
keeping with everything around them and with everything
they have been brought up to regard as right and
proper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But &lsquo;these people&rsquo; represent only one portion of the
Italians, Miss Thayer,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;Italian
civic life contains two great contrasting factors&mdash;one
practical, the other ideal. Each in its way is proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of the past; the first thinks more of the present and the
future, while the second, opposed on principle to innovations,
only accepts, and then under protest, those which
come from Italian sources. This car we are riding in
is of French manufacture. Were it Italian, you would
find that it would have been greeted with smiles instead
of scowls just now. And yet I like their patriotism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it does seem a sacrilege for the wonderful old
towers and walls here in Florence to be torn down to
make room for prosaic twentieth-century trolley-cars,&rdquo;
Helen added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Armstrong says there is talk of a board
road being built for automobiles between <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Mestre</span> and
Venice. What will dear old Italy be when &lsquo;modern
civilization&rsquo; has finished with her?&rdquo; Inez asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From present tendencies,&rdquo; remarked Uncle Peabody,
gravely, &ldquo;I expect to live to see the day when the Venetian
gondola will be propelled by gasolene; when the
Leaning Tower of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pisa</span> will either be straightened by
some enterprising American engineer or made to lean a
bit more, so that automobiles may make the ascent, even
as the Colosseum at Rome is already turned over to Buffalo
Bill or some other descendant of Barnum&rsquo;s circus
for regular performances, including the pink lemonade
and the peanuts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Inez cried. &ldquo;It would be far better to go
to the other extreme, which Mr. Armstrong would like
to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The road was level and smooth, now that the rough
streets of the city lay behind them, and there was nothing
to think of until after reaching <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Empoli</span>. Armstrong
had been running the machine, and he turned his head
just in time to hear Inez&rsquo; last remark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can imagine what the conversation is, even though
I have not heard much of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I am
sure that I agree with Miss Thayer. How about getting
back to our work at the library to-morrow?&rdquo; he
added.</p>

<p>Inez flushed at the suddenness of the question, and
Helen caught her breath. The time for her decision,
then, was near at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am as eager as you are to resume it,&rdquo; replied Inez,
her face lighting with pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is all arranged,&rdquo; Armstrong said, decisively.
&ldquo;Helen and Uncle Peabody may have the machine to-morrow,
and we will start in again where we left off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arno</span> winds around and about in a hundred curves
between Florence and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pisa</span>, leaving the road for some
little distance at times, but ever coming back to it in
flirtatious manner. The fields stretch away between the
river and the road in undulating green. Small hamlets
like <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Romano</span>, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Rotta</span>, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Navacchio</span>, and the
more pretentious settlements of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Signa</span>, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Empoli</span>, and
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pontedera</span> give variety to the ride and add by their old-time
strangeness to the beauties which Nature so bountifully
supplies. But the climax comes at the end of the
journey, after crossing the tracks at the very modern
station and the bridge which spans the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arno</span>. Over the
roofs of the quaint twelfth-century houses rise the Cathedral
and the Leaning Tower and the pillared dome
of the Baptistry.</p>

<p>The motor-car was halted in front of the little doorway
of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Htel Nettuno</span>, where the host appeared with
all his affability, offering opportunities for removing the
dust accumulated by the ride, and a choice <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">colazione</i> to
be ready as soon as might be desired. Helen was preoccupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
during the preparations for luncheon, but Inez&rsquo;
excitement over her first visit to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pisa</span>, and Armstrong&rsquo;s
eagerness to watch the effect of the early impressions,
saved her changed demeanor from attracting any attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hard to realize that this is the city of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ugolino</span>
and the Tower of Hunger after this sumptuous repast,&rdquo;
remarked Jack, lighting his cigarette with much satisfaction
as coffee was being served.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably the &lsquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Nettuno</span>&rsquo; was not in existence at that
time,&rdquo; suggested Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this not where the wonderful echo is to be heard?&rdquo;
inquired Inez.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;at the Baptistry,&rdquo; Armstrong replied; &ldquo;and
you are sure to enjoy it&mdash;the sacristan makes up such a
funny face when he intones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The echo at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Montecatini</span>, I understand, is taking a
long vacation,&rdquo; observed Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; inquired Inez, innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The regular echo was ill, and the sacristan failed
to coach the new boy properly. The visitor called,
&lsquo;What is the hour?&rsquo; and the echo came back, &lsquo;Four
o&rsquo;clock&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack and Inez led the way from the hotel, through the
narrow walled streets and under the gateway to the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza del Duomo</span>, where all the splendor of the marvellous
group of buildings burst upon them. Helen pleaded
fatigue and asked to be left in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Duomo</span> while the
others set out to climb the Leaning Tower and to inspect
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Campo Santo</span>; so Uncle Peabody insisted on
staying with her. They sat down on one of the wooden
benches beneath the lamp of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Galileo</span>, and Helen rested
her head upon her hand. Uncle Peabody watched her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
curiously for a moment. Finally he took her hand quietly
in his. Helen started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would do it if I were you, Helen,&rdquo; he said, deliberately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; she asked, surprised into confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what you were thinking of doing when I interrupted
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I was thinking, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Uncle Peabody spoke in a very matter-of-fact
way. &ldquo;But I am sure it is the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked at him steadily, uncertain of just how
far he had surmised her secret thought. There was
nothing in the calm, unruffled expression which gave
her even an inkling as to whether her peculiar sensation
was caused by his intuition or her own self-consciousness.
Then her gaze relaxed, and she laughed half-heartedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have mislaid your divining-cap this time,&rdquo;
Helen said at length. &ldquo;If you had really read my
mind your advice would have been quite different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody was undisturbed. &ldquo;In that case you
will exercise your woman&rsquo;s prerogative and change it
within the next twenty-four hours. When that has taken
place you will find that my advice fits it exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had your confidence, Uncle Peabody.&rdquo;
Helen rose suddenly and held out her hand to her companion.
&ldquo;Come, let us go into the sunlight, where things
look more cheerful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody watched the figure militant as Helen
preceded him down the broad aisle, past the small altars,
and out into the air. He recalled this same attitude when
Helen had been a child, and he remembered the determination
and the strength of will which went with it at
that time. He had forgotten this characteristic in meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
his niece grown to womanhood and in the midst of
such apparently congenial surroundings. Now he felt
that he knew the occasion for its reappearance.</p>

<p>Inez and Jack soon joined them, and together they
returned to the hotel. A few moments later the car was
gliding back toward Florence again, in the refreshing
cool of the afternoon, with changed color effects to give
new impressions to the panorama of the morning. They
were almost home when Armstrong turned suddenly to
Helen:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How absolutely stupid of me!&rdquo; he said, abruptly.
&ldquo;I met Phil Emory on the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lung&rsquo; Arno</span> yesterday and
asked him to take dinner with us to-night.&rdquo; Armstrong
looked at his watch. &ldquo;We shall be just about in time,
anyhow, but I am sorry not to have told you about it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<h3>X</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>When Helen Cartwright had accepted Phil
Emory as escort for the Harvard Class Day
festivities, on the occasion of his graduation,
every one had considered the matter of their engagement
as settled; that is to say, every one except Helen and
Emory. This view of the matter did not occur to Helen,
even as a remote possibility, and Phil Emory had absolute
knowledge to the contrary, since Helen herself had
answered his question very clearly, even though not satisfactorily,
some months before this event took place. But
she liked him immensely none the less, and saw no reason
why she should not throw confetti at him from the circus-like
seats of the Stadium, or eat strawberries and ices
with him and her other friends at the various Class Day
spreads. In fact, she saw every reason for doing so,
inasmuch as she thoroughly enjoyed it; and Emory was
proud enough to act as host under any conditions whatever.</p>

<p>After graduation Emory probably had as good a
chance as any one until Jack Armstrong entered the
field. The younger man had become more and more intense
in his devotion, but when he found himself out-classed
by the force of Armstrong&rsquo;s attack he accepted
his defeat generously and philosophically. No one contributed
more to the jollity of the wedding breakfast or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
extended heartier congratulations to the bride and bridegroom.</p>

<p>Emory&rsquo;s visit at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span>, when he first
arrived in Italy, was one of the pleasantest experiences
of his whole trip thus far. Never had he seen a more
glorious spot, and never had he seen Helen so radiantly
beautiful. He had remarked to Eustis more than once
during their stay that an Italian background was the
one thing needful to show off Helen&rsquo;s charms to the
greatest perfection. When he returned to Florence,
therefore, he determined to see her again, making his
belated duty call the excuse; so the fortunate meeting
with Armstrong and the invitation which resulted fitted
in most agreeably with his plans.</p>

<p>The automobile passed Emory in his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vettura</i> half-way
up the hill. &ldquo;Good-bye, old chap! Must hurry, as we
have company coming for dinner!&rdquo; cried Armstrong,
gayly, as the machine glided past him, giving him only
a vision of waving hands before he became enveloped in
the cloud of dust. When he arrived at the villa he found
Helen and Jack awaiting him as if they had been at home
all the afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a pleasant surprise, Phil,&rdquo; said Helen,
cordially. &ldquo;Until Jack told me you were in Florence
I supposed you and Dick Eustis had at least reached
London by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Emory replied, as they walked into the garden;
&ldquo;I only went as far north as Paris. Eustis continued
on to London, and is there now, I expect, but I ran across
Ferdy De Peyster in Paris. He had a frightfully sick
turn, and I had to take care of him for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ferdy was sick, you say?&rdquo; Helen was eagerly interested.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean dangerously so?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not as things turned out; but I will admit I
was a bit anxious about him for a time. He had been
terribly cut up over something, and then caught a beastly
cold on his lungs, and I thought he was in for a severe
case of pneumonia. He was pretty sandy about it, and
in a week he came around all right. I took him over
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aix</span>, where I left him, and then I decided to sail home
from Naples instead of Southampton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you what the trouble was?&rdquo; Helen was
anxious to know how confidential De Peyster had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affaire de c&oelig;ur</i> he said; but he did not tell
me who the girl was. He spoke of his call on you and
Miss Thayer, here, shortly after we departed, but the
poor chap was not very communicative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me for deserting you, Emory,&rdquo; interrupted
Armstrong as he approached them from the house, closely
followed by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span> bearing a tray. &ldquo;This is one
part of the dinner which I never leave to any one else.
These Italians know a lot of things better than we do,
but mixing cocktails is not one of their long suits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! that is a grateful reward to a dusty
throat!&rdquo; said Emory, replacing the glass on the tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now to dinner,&rdquo; announced Helen. &ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>
bids us enter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody and Miss Thayer joined them at the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must tell you, Mr. Cartwright,&rdquo; said Emory, after
the greetings were over, &ldquo;that what you said about eating
when I was here before made quite an impression
on me, and I have been trying your methods a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; cried Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really think I ought to make a confession,&rdquo; Emory
continued. &ldquo;I had heard about your work and all that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
but I had an idea that you were more or less of a crank,
and that your theories were the usual ones which go
with a new fad. But when you talked about understanding
and running properly one&rsquo;s own motive power
it appealed to me as being sensible. Then your idea that
the appetite is given one to tell him what the system
needs sounded reasonable to me; and when you insisted
that this same appetite had a right to be consulted as to
when enough fuel was on board I woke up to a realization
that I had not always been that respectful to myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody smiled genially. &ldquo;Have you found
the experiment very disagreeable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; replied Emory, decidedly. &ldquo;Of
course, I started in on it more as a joke than anything
else, but I have been surprised to find how much more
I really enjoy my food. Why, there are flavors in a
piece of bread which I never discovered until I chewed
it all to pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is on the same principle exactly that a tea-taster
or a wine-taster discovers the real flavor of the particular
variety he is testing. That is one thing which
gave me my idea. He sips a little and then thoroughly
mixes it with the saliva, and in that way tastes the delicate
aroma which the glutton never knows either in drink
or food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does the system work with the elaborate Continental
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d&rsquo;hte</i>, Mr. Emory?&rdquo; queried Miss Thayer.</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody answered for him: &ldquo;You became an
object of suspicion to the head-waiter, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garon</i>
thought you were criticising the food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; laughed Emory. &ldquo;But, all joking aside,
Mr. Cartwright, I have become a confirmed disciple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
I never felt so well, and I am eating about half as much
as I used to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This seems to be developing into an experience meeting,&rdquo;
Armstrong remarked. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write out
a testimonial for the gentleman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would gladly do so, but from what I hear he stands
in no need of any such document.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory turned to Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;It is a case of
being &lsquo;advertised by our grateful friends,&rsquo; is it not, Mr.
Cartwright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will you be in Florence, Phil?&rdquo; asked
Helen. &ldquo;Are you just passing through again, or is
this where you make your visit to the City of Flowers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no definite plans. My steamer doesn&rsquo;t sail
for a month, and I am moving along as the wind blows
me. Are the Sinclair girls still here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; they sailed for home last week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stay in Florence for a while and
help Helen exercise the automobile?&rdquo; suggested Armstrong.
&ldquo;Miss Thayer and I are working every day at
the library, and it will prevent her becoming lonesome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked inquiringly at her husband. This suggestion
from him, and to Phil Emory of all men! The
times had indeed altered! She saw that Emory was
observing her, and felt the necessity of relieving the
tension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not put it on that score, Jack,&rdquo; she said,
quietly. &ldquo;I am not at all lonely, but I should be very
glad to have Phil join us to-morrow. What do you say,
Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like nothing better. But tell me about this
work, Armstrong. Are you really boning down to arduous
labor on your honeymoon?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a bit out of the ordinary, is it not?&rdquo; admitted
Jack, uncertain whether or not Emory&rsquo;s question contained
a reproach. &ldquo;I would not dare do it with any
one except Helen, but she understands the necessity. I
don&rsquo;t know when I shall get another chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack is accomplishing wonders in his work,&rdquo; explained
Helen, anxious to have Emory feel her entire sympathy;
&ldquo;you must have him tell you about it. In the
mean time, while he is improving himself mentally, Uncle
Peabody and I are entering somewhat into the social
frivolities of Florence. To-morrow we are going to a
reception to be given to the Count of Turin and the
Florentine Dante Society at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Londi</span>. Jack
scorns these functions, but you will be quite in your
element. We will take you with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not that I &lsquo;scorn&rsquo; these things, as you say,
Helen,&rdquo; protested Armstrong. &ldquo;You give any one an
entirely wrong idea. They are all right enough in their
own way, but I can get these at home. This chance at
the library, however, is one in a lifetime, and I feel that
I must improve it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;that is what I meant to
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory glanced from one to the other quietly. &ldquo;I
shall be most happy to go if you are quite sure I won&rsquo;t
interfere with the plans you have already made. You
know I am not on speaking terms with Italian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to be,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody assured him.
&ldquo;These Italians speak English so well that you will be
ashamed of your ignorance. You will have no difficulty
in making yourself understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was rebellious at heart that Jack should have
suggested Emory to relieve her loneliness. It was enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that he was willing to be away from her so much without
taking it for granted and referring to it in such a
matter-of-fact way. Inez as well came in for her share
of the resentment, her very silence during the discussion
serving to aggravate Helen&rsquo;s discomfiture. Helen deliberately
turned the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking of poor Ferdy, Phil. Have
you heard from him since you left him at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aix</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I should have heard if all had not been going
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with De Peyster?&rdquo; asked Armstrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did not hear what Phil told me about him
before dinner, Jack. He has been very ill, and Phil took
him over to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aix</span> for a cure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first time De Peyster&rsquo;s name had been mentioned
since his abrupt departure, and Inez flushed deeply
as she listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the trouble, Emory?&rdquo; asked Armstrong,
innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came pretty near having pneumonia,&rdquo; replied
Emory. &ldquo;He was hard hit with a girl somewhere over
here, and was thrown down, I suspect. Then he grew
careless and was a pretty sick chap when I ran across
him in Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong had no idea of the result of his question.
He glanced hastily at Inez and gulped down half a glass
of wine, nearly choking himself in the process.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go!&rdquo; exclaimed Uncle Peabody, quite understanding
the situation and wishing to relieve the embarrassment.
&ldquo;You will drown yourself one of these
fine days if you don&rsquo;t listen to my teachings and profit
by Mr. Emory&rsquo;s example.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>But Emory was quite unconscious of the delicate
ground upon which he trod. The days and nights
he had spent with De Peyster were still strongly impressed
upon his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you might know something about this,
Helen,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;for Ferdy mentioned your name
and Miss Thayer&rsquo;s several times while he was delirious.
I could not make out anything he said, he was so incoherent.
Later, when he began to improve, I asked him
about it, but he evidently did not care to talk. But how
stupid I have been!&rdquo; He broke off suddenly and turned
to Miss Thayer. &ldquo;Here I have been sitting beside you
all this time and never once offered my congratulations!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez drew back from the proffered hand. The color
left her face as suddenly as it had come. &ldquo;What do
you mean?&rdquo; she stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, De Peyster told me you were engaged,&rdquo; Emory
said, quite taken aback. &ldquo;Have I said something I
ought not to? He said you told him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. De Peyster had no right to say that!&rdquo; Inez
cried, fiercely, almost breaking into tears.</p>

<p>Emory was most contrite. &ldquo;Ten thousand pardons,&rdquo;
he apologized. &ldquo;You must forgive me, Miss Thayer.
Ferdy never suggested that it was a secret at all&mdash;and
now I have given the whole thing away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory wished himself half-way across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much annoyed,&rdquo; replied Inez, still struggling
to contain herself&mdash;&ldquo;not with you, but with Mr.
De Peyster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she is not engaged,&rdquo; Armstrong insisted, with
decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Inez had better be left to settle that point
herself, Jack,&rdquo; Helen interrupted, pointedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why does she not settle it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will settle it.&rdquo; Inez sat up very straight in her
chair, her tense features making her face look drawn in
its ashy paleness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack has no right to force you into any such position,
Inez,&rdquo; Helen protested, indignantly; &ldquo;he is forgetting
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;De Peyster is responsible for the whole thing.&rdquo;
Emory struggled to step in between the clash of arms.
&ldquo;I recall the very words. &lsquo;Phil, old chap,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you
remember Miss Thayer? She is engaged. She told me
she had found some one whom she loved better than her
life.&rsquo; Can you blame me for making such a consummate
ass of myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s intense interest had taken him too deeply
into the affair for him to heed Helen&rsquo;s protests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never said anything of the kind, did you, Miss
Thayer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not engaged,&rdquo; replied Inez, very firmly, &ldquo;and
I cannot understand why Mr. De Peyster should have
put me in this uncomfortable position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; assented Armstrong, with evident
satisfaction. &ldquo;De Peyster is a fool. I will tell him so
the next time I see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we had better change the subject,&rdquo; said
Helen, rising, her face flushed with indignation. &ldquo;The
methods of the Inquisition have no place at a modern
dinner-table.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XI</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>Inez Thayer had congratulated herself upon her
success in keeping her secret. Since her searching
self-examination and the harrowing experience during
De Peyster&rsquo;s brief visit she had spent many hours inwardly
debating the proper steps to take in order to
solve her problem. She was certain that no one knew
the real state of affairs, and with this certainty the only
danger lay in its effect upon herself. But she knew all
too well that this danger was indeed a real one. Day
by day her admiration for Armstrong increased, and
with that admiration her affection waxed stronger and
stronger. Those hours together at the library&mdash;when
they were quite alone, when his face, in their joint absorption
in their work, almost touched hers, when his
hand rested unconsciously for a moment upon her own&mdash;were
to her moments in the Elysian Fields, and she
quaffed deeply of the intoxicating draught. What harm,
she argued to herself, since her companion was oblivious
to her hidden sentiments&mdash;what disloyalty to her friend,
since the pain must all be hers? And the pain was hers
already&mdash;why not revel in its ecstasy while it lasted?</p>

<p>With her conscience partially eased by her labored
conclusions, Inez threw herself into a complete enjoyment
of her work. Helen&rsquo;s attitude toward her had not
in any way altered, and she was still apparently entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
agreeable to the arrangement. Her suggestion to join
them in their labors was the only evidence which Inez
had seen that perhaps her friend was becoming restless,
even though not ready to raise any objections; but when
Helen herself gave up the idea, after her single visit to
the library, Inez was convinced that she had misunderstood
her motive. Nothing remained, therefore, but to
accept her previous argument that she was simply following
the inexorable guidance of Fate, with herself
the only possible victim. It was uncomfortable, it was
wearing, but she could not, she repeated over and over
again, remove herself from the exquisite suffering of her
surroundings until she was absolutely obliged to do so.</p>

<p>The episode at the dinner-table completely shattered
the structure she had built, and its sudden demolition
stunned her. This she vaguely realized as she and
Helen left the men at the table and walked to the veranda
for their coffee. Their departure was in itself an
evidence of new and strained conditions, as both Helen
and Jack regarded the coffee-and-cigar period as the
best part of every dinner and a part to be enjoyed together.
Helen had not yet acquired the Continental
cigarette habit, but, as she had once expressed it, &ldquo;Men
are so good-natured right after dinner, when they are
stuffed, and so happy when they are making silly little
clouds of smoke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez hesitatingly passed her arm around her friend&rsquo;s
waist, and when Helen drew her closely to her she rested
her head against her shoulder, relaxing like a tired
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who would have expected this outcome of such a
happy day?&rdquo; Inez queried, sadly, as the two girls seated
themselves upon the wicker divan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack was a brute!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, almost savagely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all my own fault, Helen; but I could not tell
them so in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen appeared astonished. &ldquo;How do you mean?
Are you really engaged, after all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Helen; but you see when Ferdy urged me
so hard for an answer I had to tell him something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez glanced up at Helen to see how she took her explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you told him you were engaged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly that, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you loved some one better than your life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez shrank a little as she answered. &ldquo;Something
like that,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was not true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez laughed nervously. &ldquo;What an absurd question,
Helen! You know I have seen almost no one since I came
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except Jack,&rdquo; said Helen, impulsively.</p>

<p>Inez sprang to her feet. &ldquo;What do you mean, Helen?
You don&rsquo;t accuse me of being in love with your husband,
do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen pulled her down beside her again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
tragic, dear,&rdquo; she said, quietly. &ldquo;I admit that the suggestion
is unkind, after the display Jack made of himself
at the table. I am provoked with him myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo;&mdash;Inez spoke abruptly, after a moment&rsquo;s silence&mdash;&ldquo;I
think I ought to leave Florence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Inez. You are worked up over
this miserable affair, but you will forget all about it in
the morning&mdash;when you get back to your work at the library.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No; this time I really mean what I say. I ought to
have gone when my visit was up a fortnight ago; but
you were so sweet in urging me to stay, and the work
had developed with such increasing interest, that I have
just stayed on and on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry if you regret having stayed, dear. It
certainly seemed to be for the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But see what it has brought on you, Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not proud of my husband&rsquo;s behavior, I admit;
but you have even greater cause to feel annoyed than I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez seemed to be drifting hopelessly in her attempt
to find the right thing to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have felt that I ought to go for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long time?&rdquo; Helen echoed. &ldquo;Has Jack behaved
as badly as this before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that; it is the library work which makes me feel
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you are getting tired of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tired of it! Oh, Helen, I wish you could get as
much joy out of anything as I do out of this work.
Tired of it!&rdquo; Inez laughed aloud at the absurdity of
the suggestion. Then she grew serious again. &ldquo;I know
I ought to leave it, yet I cannot force myself to make
the break.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand,&rdquo; said Helen, quietly,
watching intently the struggle through which the girl
was passing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t believe I could make
any one understand it,&rdquo; replied Inez, helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk about it in this mysterious way just as
Jack does,&rdquo; continued Helen. &ldquo;There must be some
sort of spell about it, for you both are changed beings
since your first visit to the library.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you have noticed it?&rdquo; Inez looked up anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I have noticed it,&rdquo; admitted Helen, frankly.
&ldquo;How could I help it when you yourself feel it so
strongly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you blame me for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I blame you, Inez? Is there any reason
why I should blame any one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, except that the work takes your husband away
from you so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t hold you responsible for that, can I?
It is the work which draws you both, is it not&mdash;not each
the other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez moved uneasily and withdrew her hand from
Helen&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;Of course it is the work,&rdquo; she answered,
quietly; &ldquo;but, frankly, would you not rather have it
discontinued?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Helen, without hesitation; &ldquo;but I sincerely
wish Jack might be less completely absorbed by
it. I have no intention of opposing it, and I am willing
to sacrifice much for its success, yet I see no reason why
it should so wholly deprive me of my husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has opened up an entirely new world for me.&rdquo;
Inez seemed suddenly obsessed by a reminiscent thought.
Her troubled expression changed into one of rapt ecstasy.
Helen watched the transformation, deeply impressed by
the strange new light which she saw in the girl&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;I must be more impressionable than I supposed,&rdquo; she
continued, &ldquo;for it all seems so real. I can see <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span>&rsquo;s
face as I read his letters; I can see his lips move,
his expression change&mdash;I can even hear his voice. I have
watched him fashion the great David out of the discarded
marble; I have heard his discussions with Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Julius and Pope Leo; I have witnessed his struggle with
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Leonardo</span> at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Palazzo Vecchio</span>. The events come so
fast, and the letters give such minute information upon
so many topics, that I actually feel myself in the midst
of it all. I know <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vittoria Colonna</span> as well as <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span>
ever did, and I know far better than he why she
refused to marry him. All these great characters, and
others, live and move and converse with us these mornings
at the library.&rdquo; Inez paused to get her breath.
She was talking very fast. &ldquo;I know it sounds uncanny,&rdquo;
she went on, &ldquo;but there is something in the very
atmosphere which makes me forget who or what I am.
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> comes and stands beside us, rubbing his hands together
and smiling, and yet we hardly notice him. He
is a part of it all. What he says seems no more real
than the conversations and the communions we have with
the others who died centuries ago. I realize how inexplicable
all this must sound to you, because I find myself
absolutely unable to explain it to myself. It must be a
spell, as you say, but I have no strength to break it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be something,&rdquo; Helen admitted, gravely,
&ldquo;to affect both you and Jack the same way. I wonder
what it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez paid no heed to the interrogation. &ldquo;You should
see your husband, Helen, when he is at his work. You
don&rsquo;t really know him as you see him here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen felt herself impressed even more strongly than
she had been during her visit to the library. Inez spoke
with the same intensity and conviction which at that
time had overwhelmed her previously conceived plans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> said the same thing&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> is right,&rdquo; Inez interrupted. &ldquo;Your husband
is a god among them all. He is not a mere student,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
searching for facts, but one of those great spirits themselves,
looking into their lives and their characters with
a power and an intimacy which only a contemporary and
an equal could do. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> says that his book will be a
masterpiece&mdash;that it will place him among the great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i>
of his time. No such work has been produced in
years; and you will be so proud of him, Helen&mdash;so
proud that he belongs to you! Is it not worth the sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As her friend paused Helen bowed her head in silence.
&ldquo;So proud that he belongs to you,&rdquo; Inez had just said.
Did he belong to her&mdash;had he ever belonged to her? The
new light in Inez&rsquo; eyes, the intensity of her words, both
convinced and controlled her. What was she, even
though his wife, to stand in the way of such a championship?
What were the conventions of commonplace domestic
life in the presence of this all-compelling genius?
She felt her resentment against Jack become unimportant.
With such absorption it was but natural that he
should not act like other men.</p>

<p>The sound of voices in the hall brought both girls to
themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dare we come out?&rdquo; asked Uncle Peabody, cautiously,
pausing at the door. &ldquo;These back-sliders are very
repentant, and I will vouch for their good behavior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only one of us who requires forgiveness,&rdquo;
added Armstrong, frankly, advancing to the divan. &ldquo;I
owe you both an apology; first of all to my wife, for not
heeding her good advice, and then to my &lsquo;sister-worker,&rsquo;
as <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> calls her, for adding to her discomfiture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Inez will forgive you, I will cheerfully add my
absolution,&rdquo; replied Helen, forcing a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was really afraid that I was going to lose my right-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
man,&rdquo; continued Armstrong by way of explanation,
&ldquo;and my work must then have come to an abrupt
conclusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You give me altogether too much credit,&rdquo; replied
Inez. &ldquo;The work is already so much a part of yourself
that you could not drop it if you lost a dozen &lsquo;sister-workers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must never come to that, Jack,&rdquo; added Helen,
seriously. &ldquo;Inez will surely stay until the book is completed,
and I shall do what little I can to help it to a
glorious success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a sweet, sympathizing little wife.&rdquo; Armstrong
placed his hand affectionately upon her shoulder.
&ldquo;Your interest in it will be all that I need to make it so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory and Uncle Peabody instinctively glanced at
each other, and for a moment their eyes met. It was but
an instant, yet in that brief exchange each knew where
the other stood.</p>

<p>All Florence&mdash;social, literary, and artistic&mdash;was at
the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Londi</span> reception. The ancient villa, once the
possession of the great Dante, fell into gentle hands
when the present owner, thirty years before, entered into
an appreciative enjoyment of his newly acquired property.
The structure itself was preserved and restored
without destroying the original beauty of its architecture;
the walls were renovated and hung with rich tapestries
and rare paintings; priceless statuary found a
place in the courts and corridors, but with such perfect
taste that one felt instinctively that each piece belonged
exactly where it stood as a part of the complete harmony.</p>

<p>Florentine society possesses two strong characteristics&mdash;hospitality
and sincerity. No people in the world so
cordially welcome strangers who come properly introduced
to settle temporarily in their midst; no people so
plainly manifest their estimates of their adopted aliens.
There is no half-way, there is no compromise. They
are courteous always, they are considerate even when they
disapprove; but when once they accept the stranger into
their circle they make him feel that he is and always
has been a part of themselves.</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody had won this place long since. His
genial disposition and quiet philosophy appealed to them
from the first by its very contrast to their own impulsive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Latin temperament. It was an easy matter, therefore,
for him to introduce his niece to those whom he counted
among his friends, and this he made it a point to
do when he discovered how much she would otherwise
have been alone. Helen had ceased to urge Jack to accompany
her, and he seemed quite content to be omitted.
Their first weeks in Florence had been devoted to getting
settled in their villa and in rambling over the surrounding
hills, entirely satisfied with their own society. The house-party
had taken up another week, and even before the
guests had departed Armstrong began his researches at
the library, which required a larger portion of each day
as time went on. The moment when Helen and Jack
would naturally have jointly assumed their social pleasures
and responsibilities had passed, and the necessity for
diversion of some kind prompted Helen gratefully to accept
her uncle as a substitute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a countrywoman of ours&mdash;the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contessa
Morelli</span>,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody remarked, as he skilfully piloted
Helen and Emory away from the crush in the reception-hall,
indicating a strikingly attractive woman surrounded
by a group of Italian gallants. &ldquo;She came
from Milwaukee, I believe, and married the title, with
the husband thrown in as a gratuity for good measure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looks far too refined and agreeable to answer
to your description,&rdquo; Helen replied, after regarding the
object of his comments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is refined and agreeable,&rdquo; assented Uncle Peabody,
&ldquo;and&mdash;worldly. When you have once seen the
count you will understand. She is a neighbor of yours,
so you must meet her&mdash;the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Morelli</span> is scarcely a
quarter of a mile beyond the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span>.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overlook me in the introduction, will you?&rdquo;
urged Emory, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still as fond as ever of a pretty face, Phil?&rdquo; queried
Helen, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he acquiesced, cheerfully; &ldquo;but this is
a case of national pride. You and she&mdash;the two American
Beauties present&mdash;would make any American proud
of his country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen smiled and held up a finger warningly as she
followed Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s lead. The contessa acknowledged
the introductions with much cordiality, but to
Emory&rsquo;s disappointment devoted herself at once to
Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are from dear, old, chilly Boston,&rdquo; she said,
breezily. &ldquo;The last time I passed through was on a
July day, and I was so glad I had my furs with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boston is celebrated for its east winds,&rdquo; volunteered
Emory, calmly.</p>

<p>The contessa glanced at him for a moment to make
sure that his misunderstanding was wilful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, meaningly; &ldquo;and I understand
that in Boston the revised adage reads, &lsquo;God tempers
the east wind to the blue-bloods.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I was just going to say some nice things about
Milwaukee!&rdquo; Emory continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is just as well that I discouraged you,&rdquo; the
contessa interrupted. &ldquo;No one who has not lived there
can ever think of anything complimentary to say about
Milwaukee except to expatiate upon its beer. That
seems to mark the limitations of his acquaintance with
our city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contessa turned to Helen. &ldquo;Mr. Cartwright tells
me that you and your husband are my mysterious neighbors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
about whom we have had so much curiosity. You
must let me call on you very soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was studying her new acquaintance with much
interest. Her features were as clearly cut as if the work
of a master-sculptor, yet nature had improved upon
human skill by adding a color to the cheeks and a
vivacity to the eye which made their owner irresistible
to all who met her; while the simple elegance of her
lingerie gown, in striking contrast to the dress of the
Italian women near her, set off to advantage the lines of
her graceful figure. She was a few years older than
Helen, yet evidently a younger woman in years than in
experience. Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s comments had naturally
prejudiced Helen to an extent, yet she could not resist
a certain appeal which unconsciously attracted her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we may see much of each other,&rdquo; the contessa
continued, cordially, scarcely giving Helen an opportunity
even for perfunctory replies. &ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Morelli</span> is housed
by the gout at least half of the time, and he bores me to
death with his description of the various symptoms. I
will run over to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span> and let you rehearse
your troubles for a change. But, of course, you have
no troubles&mdash;Mr. Cartwright said you were a bride, did
he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contessa noticed the color which came in Helen&rsquo;s
face, and her experience, tempered by her intuition, told
her that it was not a blush of pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your husband?&rdquo; she asked, pointedly.
&ldquo;You must present him to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is engaged upon some literary work at the library,&rdquo;
Helen replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a learned man! That is almost as bad as the
gout!&rdquo; The contessa held up her hands in mock horror.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then you will need my sympathy, after all,&rdquo; she
said, with finality. &ldquo;Oh, these husbands!&mdash;these husbands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a relief to Helen when other guests claimed the
contessa&rsquo;s attention. Uncle Peabody had mingled with
friends in the drawing-room, so she and Emory moved
on in the same direction. Here she found many whom
she had previously met, and for half an hour held a
court as large and as admiring as the contessa&rsquo;s. Emory
was quite unprepared to find his companion so much at
home in this different atmosphere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, Helen,&rdquo; he whispered, as he finally discovered
an opportunity to converse with her again,
&ldquo;one would think you had always lived in Florence.
If it were not for the gold lace of the army officers and
the white heads of the ancient gallants who flock about
you, I should almost imagine we were at the Assemblies
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one is cordiality itself,&rdquo; replied Helen. &ldquo;See
Uncle Peabody over there! Is he not having a good
time? He told me Professor Tesso, of the University of
Turin, was to be here, and I presume that is he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Following the example of the other guests, Helen and
Emory strolled out into the main court, in one corner
of which is the old well dating back to the time when
the Divine Poet slaked his thirst at its stony brim. The
sun streamed in through the narrow windows and lighted
the terra-cotta flagstones where its rays struck, making
the extreme corners of the court seem even dimmer. With
rare restraint, the only decoration consisted of long
festoons, made of lemons, pomegranates, eucalyptus,
oranges, and laurel, fashioned to resemble the majolicas
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Della Robbia</span> and hung gracefully along the stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
balcony, between which was an occasional rare old rug
or costly tapestry. Passing slowly up the spacious stairway,
stopped now and again by one or more of Helen&rsquo;s
newly acquired friends, they reached the library, where
some of the more valuable manuscripts and early printed
volumes were exposed to view. A group of book-lovers
were eagerly examining an edition of Dante resting upon
a graceful thirteenth-century <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">leggio</i>, printed by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lorenzo
Della Magna</span>, and illustrated with <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Botticelli</span>&rsquo;s remarkable
engravings. From the balcony, leading out from
the library, they gained a view of the carefully laid-out
garden, brilliant in its color display and redolent with
the mingled fragrance of myriads of blossoms.</p>

<p>Here Uncle Peabody rejoined them, bringing with him
the scholarly looking professor from Turin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen, I want you to meet Professor Tesso. He
was among the first who saw in my theories and experiments
any signs of merit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor held up his hand deprecatingly. &ldquo;You
give me too much credit, Mr. Cartwright. Judicially,
we men of science are all hidebound and look upon every
innovation as erroneous until proved otherwise. We
could not believe that your theories of body requirements
of food were sound because they differed so radically
from what we had come to regard as standard.
But when you proved yourself right by actual experiment
we had no choice in the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Peabody has been very persistent,&rdquo; said Helen,
smiling. &ldquo;His own conviction in time becomes contagious,
does it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just it,&rdquo; assented Professor Tesso. &ldquo;What
he had told us is something which we really should have
known all the time, but we failed to recognize its importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Now he has forced us to accept it, and the
credit is properly his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have invited Professor Tesso to take tea with us
to-morrow afternoon, Helen, at the villa,&rdquo; said Uncle
Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; Helen urged, cordially. &ldquo;We shall
be so glad to welcome you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sudden exodus of the guests gave notice that
something unusual was occurring below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be the arrival of the Count of Turin,&rdquo; explained
Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;Let us descend and take a
look at Italian royalty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the others they entered the magnificent ball-room&mdash;a
modern addition to the original villa made by
Napoleon for his sister Pauline when she became Grand-Duchess
of Tuscany. In the centre of the room, surrounded
by his suite, stood the count, graciously receiving
the guests presented to him by his host. Hither
and thither among the crowd ran little flower-maidens
bestowing favors upon the ladies and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boutonnires</i> upon
their escorts. A few pieces of music played quietly behind
a bank of palms, the low strains blending pleasantly
with the hum of conversation.</p>

<p>As Helen and Emory stood with a few Italian friends,
a little apart from the others, watching the brilliant
throng, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> suddenly joined them. Helen had never
thought of him outside the library, and it seemed to
her as if one of the chained volumes had broken away
from its anchorage. The old man saw the surprise in
her face and smiled genially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seldom come to gatherings such as this,&rdquo; he explained,
even before the question was put to him; &ldquo;but
his Highness commanded me to meet him here.&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
smiled again and looked into Helen&rsquo;s face with undisguised
admiration. &ldquo;This is where you belong,&rdquo; he
assured her, quietly but enthusiastically&mdash;&ldquo;this is your
element. Do you not see that I was right that day at
the library? You are even more beautiful than when I
saw you before. There is a new strength in your face.
You are a creation of the master-artist, like a marvellous
painting which intoxicates the senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen had no answer, but the old man continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just left your husband and his sister-worker.
They are not beautiful&mdash;they represent the wisdom which
one finds in books. The world needs both, my daughter.
Be content.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And without waiting for a reply <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> disappeared
in the crowd of guests as suddenly as he had come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XIII</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>Emory was the only one near enough to Helen to
observe the interview with <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>. The old man&rsquo;s
words were uttered in too low a tone to reach his
ears, but Emory saw Helen close her eyes for a fraction
of a second and heard her draw a quick breath. Then
she turned to him with a smile so natural that he nearly
believed himself deceived, and found himself almost convinced
that he must have been mistaken in what he
thought he had discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose little old man is that?&rdquo; Emory queried.</p>

<p>Helen laughed. Emory had a way of putting questions
in a form least expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsignor <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and he belongs
to Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is the librarian!&rdquo; Phil recognized the descriptions
he had heard at the villa. &ldquo;Interesting-looking
old chap; I don&rsquo;t wonder Jack likes him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a wonderful man,&rdquo; assented Helen; &ldquo;but his
knowledge almost frightens one. I feel like an ignorant
child every time I meet him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They strolled slowly through the brilliant throng out
into the court, up the stairs, and into the library again.
The room was wholly deserted, the other guests preferring
to watch the spectacle below. No word was spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
until Helen threw herself into a great chair near the
balcony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an awful thing it is to have so little knowledge!&rdquo;
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Emory looked at her in surprise. At first he could
not believe her serious, but the expression on her face
was convincing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Compared to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Compared to any one who has brains&mdash;like Jack or
Inez.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory studied his companion carefully. The impression
made upon him a few moments before, then, was
no hallucination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> say which upset you, Helen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>?&rdquo; Helen repeated. &ldquo;Why, nothing. As a
matter of fact, he was very complimentary&mdash;even gallant.
Some of you younger men could take lessons from
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> in the gentle art of flattery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Helen,&rdquo; Emory apologized;
&ldquo;I had no intention of intruding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear old Phil,&rdquo; cried Helen, holding out her hand
impulsively, &ldquo;of course you had not, and you could not
intrude, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory held the proffered hand a moment before it was
withdrawn. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help feeling concerned when I see
something disturb you,&rdquo; he said, quietly&mdash;&ldquo;now, any
more than I could before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen saw that she had not succeeded in deceiving him,
but was determined that he should discover as little as
possible. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Florence is just the right atmosphere
for me,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I did not notice at first
how much more every one here knows about everything
than I do, and it makes me feel uncomfortable. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
is what I meant. Of course one expects this supreme
knowledge in a man like <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, but even those Florentines
whom one meets casually at receptions such as
this are as well informed on literature and art and music
as those whom we consider experts at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This lack of knowledge on your part does not seem
to interfere any with their admiration for you,&rdquo; insisted
Emory. &ldquo;If Jack took the trouble to see how much attention
you received he might have a little less interest
in that precious work of his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not speak like that, Phil,&rdquo; Helen protested.
&ldquo;Jack is doing something which neither you
nor I can appreciate, but that is our own fault and not
his. I only wish I could understand it. Every one says
that his book will make him famous, and then we all
shall be proud of him&mdash;even prouder than we are now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory rose impatiently. &ldquo;You are quite right,
Helen,&mdash;I certainly don&rsquo;t appreciate it, under the circumstances;
but I shall put my foot in this even worse
than I did yesterday with Miss Thayer, so I suggest
that we change the subject. Come, let us see what is
going on down-stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody met them in the court. &ldquo;I was coming
after you,&rdquo; he said by way of explanation. &ldquo;Tesso has
just left, and we also must make our <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">adieux</span>. Would you
mind taking Mr. Emory and me to the Florence Club,
Helen, on the way home? He might like to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their appearance in the hall was a signal for the unattached
men again to surround Helen with protestations
of regret that she had absented herself from the
reception-room, and Emory watched the episode with
grim satisfaction. Uncle Peabody appeared to take no
notice of anything except his responsibility, and gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
guided the party to where their host and hostess
were standing, and then out to the automobile. An invigorating
run down the hill, past the walls which shut
out all but the luxuriant verdure of the high cypresses,
alternating with the olive and lemon trees, and through
the town, brought them to the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza Vittorio Emanuele</span>,
where the car paused for a moment to allow the men to
alight. Then, after brief farewells, Helen continued her
ride alone to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Settignano</span>.</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody led the way up the stairs to a small
room leading off from the main parlor of the club. Producing
some cigars, he motioned to Emory to make himself
comfortable at one end of a great leather-covered
divan, while he drew up a chair for himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought you here for a definite purpose,&rdquo; he announced
as soon as the preliminaries were arranged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can divine the purpose,&rdquo; replied Emory,
striking a match and lighting his cigar.</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody looked at his companion inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is about Helen, is it not?&rdquo; continued Emory, without
waiting for Mr. Cartwright to question him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; assented Uncle Peabody; &ldquo;and your intuition
makes my task the easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not intuition,&rdquo; corrected Emory; &ldquo;it is observation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, call it what you like&mdash;the necessity is the
same. Perhaps I have no right to discuss this matter
with you, but I understand you have known Helen for
a good while and pretty well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So well that I would have married her if she had ever
given me the chance,&rdquo; asserted Emory, calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you make out of the case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girl is desperately unhappy.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She is. But how are we going to help her without
making things a thousand times worse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory smoked his cigar meditatively. &ldquo;I have been
thinking of that, too,&rdquo; he replied at length, &ldquo;but with
no more success, apparently, than yourself. It is a
rather delicate matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no question about that.&rdquo; Uncle Peabody
spoke decisively. &ldquo;And this is all the more reason why
we should talk things over together. We are the only
ones who can possibly straighten matters out, and I am
not at all certain that we can accomplish anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think Armstrong himself realizes the situation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the slightest. He is absolutely absorbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about Miss Thayer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody looked at Emory interrogatively.
&ldquo;What have you observed about Miss Thayer?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That she is exceedingly sensitive upon the subject
of her engagement,&rdquo; replied Emory, with feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you come to any conclusion as to the reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory was surprised by the implied meaning in Mr.
Cartwright&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he said, slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was here when De Peyster proposed to her,&rdquo; Uncle
Peabody continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she was the girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was the girl,&rdquo; repeated his companion. &ldquo;When
she threw him over, she did not tell him that she was engaged,
as he repeated to you, but that she loved some
one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A wave of understanding passed over Emory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the some one else was&mdash;Armstrong! What a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>stupid fool I&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo; Emory rose and walked to
the window. Suddenly he turned. &ldquo;Does Helen know
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without a doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why does she not put a stop to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you have at length arrived at my standpoint,&rdquo;
replied Uncle Peabody, with satisfaction. &ldquo;Helen knows
it, I am convinced. Miss Thayer, of course, knows her
own feelings. Armstrong is head over heels in this alleged
masterpiece of his, and I give him credit for appreciating
Miss Thayer&rsquo;s sentiments toward him as little
as he does Helen&rsquo;s sufferings. Except for this I
should not think of interfering, but under the circumstances
I feel that between us we may have a chance to
straighten things out before the principals know that
there is anything which needs straightening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a fair statement of the basis of the conspiracy,&rdquo;
said Emory, returning to his seat; &ldquo;but have
you worked out the details as carefully?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Uncle Peabody, frankly. &ldquo;That is
a more difficult proposition, and I doubt if we can formulate
any definite plan. It occurred to me that if we
joined forces we would stand a better chance of hitting
upon some expedient when the opportunity offered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen seems more or less reconciled, in spite of what
we know she feels,&rdquo; said Emory, reflectively; &ldquo;you
heard what she said to Armstrong last evening about
helping his work to a glorious success?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is trying desperately to be reconciled, and she
thinks she has concealed her real feelings,&rdquo; replied Uncle
Peabody; &ldquo;but she is eating her heart out all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish I thought I could help her some way.&rdquo;
Emory rose and extended his hand. &ldquo;I have never looked
upon myself as much of a success in matters like this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Mr. Cartwright, but there is nothing I would not do for
Helen&mdash;even to helping her to get a divorce!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody smiled as he took Emory&rsquo;s hand and
held it firmly. &ldquo;I suspect you will have to eliminate
yourself if you hope to accomplish anything. If I know
Helen at all, she will never take another chance if this
first venture turns out unfortunately. But let us hope
that all will right itself, and that we may be the direct
or indirect means of its so doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amen to that,&rdquo; assented Emory, warmly. &ldquo;I have
wanted Helen always, but I should be a brute if I did
not want her happiness first of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I had made no mistake,&rdquo; replied Uncle
Peabody. &ldquo;I rather pride myself on my skill in reading
human nature, and I should have been disappointed in
you had you failed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="r3">Uncle Peabody was late in returning to the villa, and
the family had already seated themselves at dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all going for a moonlight ride,&rdquo; announced
Armstrong as Mr. Cartwright apologized for his tardy
appearance, &ldquo;and we felt sure you would soon be here.
Did you ever see such a perfect evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody resolved to try an experiment. &ldquo;May
I venture to suggest an amendment?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What improvement can you possibly make on my
plan?&rdquo; Armstrong was incredulous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply that Miss Thayer and I give you and Helen
a chance to enjoy the ride by yourselves, after the style
of true honeymooners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s face flushed with pleasure, but Armstrong resented
any change in his original arrangement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Helen and I are not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
sentimental, I trust, as to wish to keep you and Miss
Thayer from enjoying the ride with us on such a night
as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Mr. Cartwright&rsquo;s amendment an excellent
one,&rdquo; said Inez. &ldquo;It will be much better for you and
Helen to go by yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you have broken up the whole party!&rdquo; Armstrong
turned petulantly on Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;Miss
Thayer has been working all the afternoon in the library,
and needs the refreshment of the air even more than
Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Miss Thayer will permit,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody,
maintaining his ground stoutly, &ldquo;I will do my best
to make her evening an agreeable one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong was not appeased, but could hardly do
other than accept the situation. After seeing the car
depart from the court-yard, Uncle Peabody and Miss
Thayer strolled out to the garden, where he arranged
their chairs so that they might gain the choicest view of
the moon-illumined city and the winding river, silver in
the soft, pale light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have kept you from an interesting experience,&rdquo;
Uncle Peabody began, &ldquo;but I know how much it will
mean to Helen to have her husband all to herself. You
understand, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do understand, perfectly,&rdquo; replied Inez, heartily.
&ldquo;I am only ashamed that I did not think of it myself;
but it is difficult to oppose Mr. Armstrong in anything
he has his heart set on, and I confess that I do not
possess your courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt if I should have been so courageous had I
realized how disagreeable he would be. Armstrong has
changed much in the few weeks I have known him.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Peabody made his assertion boldly, and then
waited for a response. Inez looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is hard for any one to understand Mr.
Armstrong without seeing him at his work. He has
changed, as you say, but it is a change which no one&mdash;least
of all himself&mdash;could prevent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody expected a defence&mdash;that was but natural.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I quite follow you,&rdquo; he said, wishing
to draw her out. &ldquo;Would you mind telling me more
about the work, and what there is in it to affect him in
this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could make it clear to you, for unless you
understand it you will do him a great injustice.&rdquo; Inez
again keyed herself up to her self-appointed task.
&ldquo;Helen asked me the same question last evening, and
I realized while talking with her how poorly fitted I
myself am to attempt any explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl paused. She knew that her companion would
analyze what she said much more thoroughly than Helen
had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you ever under an hypnotic influence?&rdquo; she
asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody, calmly. &ldquo;But you
don&rsquo;t mean to say that this has happened to Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; Inez continued. &ldquo;If I believed in reincarnation
I should say without hesitation that Mr.
Armstrong was living over again, here in Florence, an
existence which he had previously experienced centuries
ago. As I don&rsquo;t believe in this, I can simply say that
there is a something which comes from an intimate contact
with these master-spirits of the past which is so compelling
that it takes one out of the present and assumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
complete control over him. While we are at the library
all else is forgotten. I work there beside him hour after
hour, yet he seems entirely unconscious of my presence
except to the extent to which it assists his own efforts.
All personality is absolutely obliterated. I understand
it, because to a lesser degree I have felt it myself. When
we leave the library he becomes more like himself again;
but as he gets deeper into his work, his absorption is
greater, and for that reason alone, I believe, he is less
mindful of the usual every-day conventions. I wish I
could make it clear to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody did not reply at once. What Inez had
said gave him a new viewpoint both of Armstrong and
of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long do you think this will continue?&rdquo; he asked
at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until his work is finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when will that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another month, at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody was again silent, weighing the situation
from the present standpoint. &ldquo;What is to become
of Helen in the mean time?&rdquo; he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>Miss Thayer had anticipated this question. &ldquo;Helen
understands the situation perfectly,&rdquo; she said, confidently.
&ldquo;She has talked it over with him and with me. It is
a sacrifice on her part to be separated from her husband,
especially at this time, but it is one which she is willing
to accept for her husband&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you be willing to accept it were the conditions
reversed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez flushed, but stood her ground bravely. &ldquo;Perhaps
not,&rdquo; she admitted; &ldquo;but Helen is a stronger
woman than I.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She does not think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen is a much stronger woman than she herself
realizes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody was thoughtful. &ldquo;Let me ask you
one more question. Do you think that this spell, or influence,
or whatever you may call it, in any way affects
Armstrong&rsquo;s affection for his wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure that it does not,&rdquo; replied Inez, with decision.
&ldquo;His devotion to Helen must be even stronger,
because he can but appreciate the splendid generosity
she is showing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He certainly adopts curious methods of demonstrating
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But consider the influences he is under!&rdquo; Inez urged.</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody admired the girl&rsquo;s handling of the catechising
he had given her. He looked steadily into her
face before replying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a noble champion, Miss Thayer,&rdquo; he said,
at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is because I have faith in the cause,&rdquo; responded
Inez, smiling. &ldquo;I have been brought up to believe that
every married woman must at some time in her life make
a supreme sacrifice for her husband. I only hope that
when my turn comes the sacrifice may be made for so
good a cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is another version of the chastening of the
spirit,&rdquo; added Uncle Peabody; &ldquo;but I am thinking of a
certain spirit which received so much chastening that it
never revived. I sincerely trust that history may not
repeat itself.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XIV</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>Uncle Peabody was entirely right when he
stated that Armstrong had become a changed man
since he first came to Florence; Miss Thayer was
right when she attributed this change to the associations
into which he had thrown himself&mdash;yet both were wrong
in thinking him unconscious of his own altered condition.
As he told Helen, he had ever felt some irresistible influence
drawing him back to Florence, even while engrossed
in the duties of his profession. Just what the
craving was he could not have explained even to himself.
What he should find in Florence had taken no definite
form in his mind, yet the longing possessed him in spite
of all he could do to reason with himself against it.</p>

<p>After his arrival in Florence, even, it was not until
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> suggested the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span> letters that he formulated
any plan to gratify his long-anticipated expectations.
His arguments with himself had prepared him
for a disappointment. It had been a boyish fancy, he
said, inwardly; he had felt the influences of his environment
simply because he had been young and impressionable,
and it was quite impossible that he should
now, man-grown, prove susceptible to anything so inexplicable
as what he had felt in his earlier days.</p>

<p>Then came the experience with <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> and Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>Thayer. She was a woman, truly, and subject to a
woman&rsquo;s physical frailties, yet she was intellectually
strong, and could not so have yielded to anything but
a controlling power. Here, then, was a second personality
affected in a like manner as himself by the same
influences. He did not try to explain it; he accepted
it as an evidence that this influence, whatever it was,
existed and made itself manifest. From that moment
he merged his own individuality into those to whom
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> with gentle suasion introduced him. The librarian
incited him by his own enthusiasm, and then directed
him along the paths which he himself so loved to tread.</p>

<p>But <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> did not foresee the extremes to which his
pupil&rsquo;s devotion would carry him. Day by day Armstrong
felt himself becoming more and more separated
from all about him, and more and more amalgamated
with those forces which had preceded him. The society
of any save those who acted and thought as he did failed
to appeal to him. His affection for Helen suffered no
change, except that she became less necessary to him.
As the work progressed the intervals away from the library
seemed longer, and he found it more difficult to
enter into the life about him. Then came an irritability,
entirely foreign to his nature, which he could not curb.</p>

<p>Yet through it all he was entirely conscious of what
was happening. He compared himself more than once
to a man in a trance, painfully alive to all the preparations
going on about him for his own entombment, yet
unable to cry out and put a stop to it all. He wished
that Helen would object to his absences and force him
to become a part of her life again. He wished that
Miss Thayer would tire of the work and leave him alone
in it. In contemplating either event he suffered at the
mere thought of what such an interruption would mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to him, he knew that he would interpose strenuous objections&mdash;yet
in a way he longed for the break to come.</p>

<p>Armstrong had been in one of these inexplicably irritable
moods when Uncle Peabody crossed him in his
plan for the moonlight ride to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Miniato</span>. As a matter
of fact, it was only because Miss Thayer had complained
of a headache as they left the library that the
idea of a ride had occurred to him at all; and to have
Mr. Cartwright calmly propose that she drop out of the
planned excursion struck him as a distinct intrusion upon
his own prerogatives. The automobile fever was out of
his blood now; the motor-car had become to him merely a
convenience, and no longer an exhilaration. It was quite
inevitable that Miss Thayer should acquiesce in Uncle
Peabody&rsquo;s suggestion&mdash;in fact, she could do nothing else;
yet at the library she accepted even his slightest suggestion
without question, and Armstrong preferred this
latter responsive attitude. All in all, he would have been
glad to find some excuse for giving up the ride altogether;
but none offered itself, so, with every movement
an obvious protest, he had helped Helen into the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tonneau</span>
and stepped in after her.</p>

<p>Helen was hardly in a happier frame of mind, yet she
found herself so eager for this time alone with her husband
that she raised none of the obstacles which she
would have done a month earlier. It was a perfect
June evening, with the air cooled enough by the light
wind to make the breeze raised by the speed of the
car agreeable to the face. The moon was just high
enough to cause deep shadows to fall across the roadway
and merge into fantastic shapes as the machine approached
and passed over them. The peasants were out-of-doors,
and expressed their contentment by snatches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
song, rendered in the rich, melodious voices which are the
natural heritage of this light-hearted people. The toil
of the day was over, and they were entering into a well-earned
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">riposo</i> before the duties of the next sunrise claimed
their strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How peaceful this is!&rdquo; Helen exclaimed, turning to
her husband. The breeze had blown back the lace scarf
from her head, and the moon fell full upon her luxuriant
hair, lighting her upturned face. &ldquo;All nature is at rest
and peace, and the people reflect the contentment of the
land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your uncle is becoming very dictatorial,&rdquo; replied
Armstrong, quite at variance with her mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was mildly reproachful, yet she instinctively felt
the necessity of being cautious. Perhaps she could make
him forget his resentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Peabody only meant to give us an opportunity
to be by ourselves. We have had so few.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He should have understood that I had some good
reason for planning matters just as I did or I should
not have done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you regret being alone with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen struggled to keep the tears out of her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Helen,&rdquo; replied Armstrong, impatiently.
&ldquo;That is not the point at all. Miss Thayer
is tired and needed this relaxation. Mr. Cartwright had
no right to interfere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long silence, during which Armstrong
relapsed into a profound taciturnity, while Helen found
it hard to know what tack to take. She glanced occasionally
at her husband, but could gain no inspiration
from his grim, set features.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Jack,&rdquo; she said, at length, &ldquo;is it not possible
for you to pursue your work at the library without
having it make you so indifferent to everything else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shifted his position uneasily. &ldquo;I am not indifferent
to everything else. The fact that I proposed this
ride is an evidence of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has something happened to make my companionship
distasteful to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong became more and more irritated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see why you are so possessed to make me uncomfortable,
Helen. But I understand what you are driving at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I driving at?&rdquo; she asked, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are taking this method to force me to put an
end to my work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen winced. &ldquo;Is that fair, Jack? What have I
said to you every time the subject has been mentioned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have told me to go ahead, and then you have
shown quite plainly by every action that you did not
mean it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack Armstrong!&rdquo; She was indignant at his gross
injustice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have I said each time the subject has come
up?&rdquo; continued Armstrong. &ldquo;You have had every opportunity
to have your own way in this as in all other
matters. I repeat it now&mdash;is it your wish that I stop my
work? Say but the word and I will never enter that
library again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was hurt through and through. To what avail
was her sacrifice if it be so little understood, so little
appreciated?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to be misunderstood in this,&rdquo; added
Armstrong, as if in answer to her thoughts. &ldquo;I quite
realize that I have asked much of you who can understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
so little of what my book means to me. I have
been entirely frank, and have accepted from you the
time which rightfully belongs to you in the spirit, as I
supposed, in which you gave it to me. If you did not
mean what you said, you have but to tell me so and it
shall be exactly as you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have meant every word I have said, Jack,&rdquo; replied
Helen, in a low, strained voice. &ldquo;I have been glad
to contribute in the only way I could to anything which
means so much to you. I simply ask you now whether
it is necessary for this absorption to include all of yourself
even when you are away from it. I did not suppose
that this was essential.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are exaggerating the situation out of all proportion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I were, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s voice had a tired note in it which Armstrong
could not fail to perceive. He was amazed by his own
apathy. Why did it mean so little to him? Why did he
sit there beside her as if he had not noticed it when in
reality he felt the pain as keenly as she did? He turned
and looked at her for the first time since they had started.
Helen gave no sign that she was conscious of his scrutiny,
lying back with her cheek resting upon her hand, her
eyes closed, her lips quivering now and then in spite of
her supreme effort to control herself. Always, before,
Armstrong would have folded her in his arms and brushed
away the heart-pains, real or imaginary as they might
have been. Now he sat watching her suffer without making
any effort to relieve her.</p>

<p>He despised himself for his attitude. What wretched
thing had come between him and this girl whom he
had idolized, and prevented him from extending even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the common sympathy which belonged to any one who
needed it? What malevolent power forced him to be
the cause of this sorrow and yet forbade him the privilege
of assuaging it? This was not the lesson learned
from the humanists. Why should not he be able to give
out to those around him the reflection of that true happiness
which their work first taught the world?</p>

<p>Helen opened her eyes suddenly and looked full into
his. Startled at the expression on his face, she sat
upright, keenly anxious and forgetful of her own
troubles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack dear,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you are not well! You are
unhappy, too! Tell me what it all means, and let us
understand it together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice brought back the old condition. His eyes
lowered and he withdrew his hand from Helen&rsquo;s impulsive
grasp. With a heart heavy for the explanation which
lay close at hand, his voice refused to obey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am perfectly well, Helen,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Why
should you think me otherwise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reaction was great, yet Helen succeeded in retaining
her control. While conscious, during the weeks past,
of the change in her husband&rsquo;s bearing toward her, she
was unprepared for his present attitude. Yet the look
in his face when she had surprised him by opening her
eyes was the old expression by which in the past she had
known that something had touched him deeply&mdash;but it
was intensified beyond anything she had ever seen. It
had always been her privilege to comfort him under these
conditions, and instinctively her heart sprang forward
to meet his. Then she saw the expression change and
she grew cold with apprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask Alfonse to turn back, please,&rdquo; she begged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
&ldquo;The air is getting chilly and I think I would rather
be home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In response to her desire the chauffeur turned the car,
and the ride back to the villa was accomplished in silence.
Helen&rsquo;s thoughts ran rampant, but further conversation
was impossible. Her pain was now tempered by her anxiety.
Jack was not well, in spite of his disclaimers. His
close application to his work in the poorly ventilated library
had undoubtedly affected him, and this was the explanation
of his otherwise inexplicable attitude toward
her. It was with positive relief that she discovered any
explanation, and as she thought things over this relief
lightened the burden she had been carrying all these
weeks more than anything which had happened since the
cloud began to gather. In some way she must plan to
relieve the pressure and bring her husband back to her
and to himself again.</p>

<p>Inez and Uncle Peabody met them at the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ride has done you good,&rdquo; said the latter, giving
his hand to Helen and noting the light in the girl&rsquo;s eyes
as they walked toward the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have left my scarf in the car,&rdquo; said Helen, turning
back so quickly that Mr. Cartwright had no opportunity
to offer his services.</p>

<p>Armstrong and Inez were standing together on the
step, and as Helen approached she could not help overhearing
her husband&rsquo;s reply to Miss Thayer&rsquo;s inquiring
looks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the only one who understands me,&rdquo; Armstrong
was saying&mdash;&ldquo;you are the only one!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<h3>XV</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>The next afternoon was a warm one, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>
searched for some little time before she discovered
Uncle Peabody half concealed within a natural
arbor formed by the falling branches of an ancient
tree. Here, in the cooling shade, he was reading over
a budget of letters just received from America. Emory
followed close behind the maid, and laughed heartily at
Mr. Cartwright&rsquo;s jump of startled surprise when <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>
broke into his absorption with the announcement
of &ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Signor Emori</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Emory!&rdquo; he cried, looking up genially from
the letter in his hand. &ldquo;I was thousands of miles away,
and two words from the lips of the gentle serving-maid
brought me back to Florence. Marconigrams are nothing
compared with the marvellous exhibition you have
just witnessed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a shame to interrupt you,&rdquo; Emory apologized.
&ldquo;I came up early hoping to have a little chat with you
before Professor Tesso and tea-time arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize, I beg of you,&rdquo; protested Uncle
Peabody, gathering up his letters and making room for
Emory to sit beside him. &ldquo;I was just on the point of returning,
anyway, and you have saved me the necessity of
packing up. In fact, you are very welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I judge your news is of an agreeable nature?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Emory saw that Uncle Peabody was eager to be questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things are advancing famously,&rdquo; replied Mr. Cartwright,
enthusiastically. &ldquo;These letters are from America,
and report the fullest success attending the experiments
there with which I am so vitally concerned. But
what are you carrying so carefully at arm&rsquo;s-length?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody peered into the little wicker cage
Emory was holding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grillo!</i>&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then to-day must be
Ascension Day and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Festa dei Grilli</i>. I had forgotten
the date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that explains why they are selling these little
cages with crickets inside of them all over the city. The
old woman I bought this of told me it was a token of
good luck, so I brought it to Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will be interested in it,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody.
&ldquo;The little <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grillo</i> brought luck once upon a time, if the
legend be true, and it may do so again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Festa dei Grilli</i>, as you call it, an annual
festival?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and as firmly established as the Feast of the
Dove on Easter eve. The story goes that an attempt
was once made upon the life of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici</span> in
his own garden by the familiar means of a goblet of
poisoned wine. As the would-be assassin handed the
goblet to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lorenzo</span> a cricket alighted on the surface of
the wine and immediately expired. Thus, as in modern
melodrama, the villain was foiled. Since then, a Florentine
would harm a human being as soon as he would a
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grillo</i>. Each year these cages are taken into the homes,
and as long as the little crickets can be kept alive
good luck attends the household.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of conspiracies,&rdquo; remarked Emory, who
lost no time in finding an opening, &ldquo;how advances
our present one? I have been thinking of nothing else
since our talk about Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody rose and glanced around the garden
from his point of vantage. &ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; he said, drawing
back. &ldquo;Helen is coming, and I can only say that
we must move very cautiously&mdash;even more so than I supposed.
I will tell you more later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are, Helen,&rdquo; he answered, in response to his
niece&rsquo;s call, and both men advanced to meet her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have found my &lsquo;snuggery&rsquo;!&rdquo; cried Helen,
seeing them emerge from the arbor. &ldquo;I intended to keep
that entirely for myself, but I will be generous and share
it with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Emory has brought you a talisman,&rdquo; said Uncle
Peabody, pointing to the wicker cage. &ldquo;Perhaps you
will permit this to appease your displeasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen examined with interest the cage Emory placed
in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it is a cricket!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as she discovered
the occupant beneath the green leaves.</p>

<p>The story of the origin of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">festa</i> was retold and the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grillo</i> placed under her special protection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an emblem of good luck, Helen,&rdquo; added Emory&mdash;&ldquo;like
the swastika, only a great deal less commonplace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Phil,&rdquo; replied Helen. Then she looked
up at him suddenly. &ldquo;Why did you bring it to me?&rdquo;
she asked, suspiciously. &ldquo;Do you think I need it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we all need all the good luck we can get,&rdquo;
replied Emory, guardedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tesso is late,&rdquo; remarked Uncle Peabody, opportunely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
looking at his watch. &ldquo;He will be greatly interested
in the reports of these American experiments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another half-hour passed by before the professor from
Turin arrived. Helen strolled about the garden with
Emory, pointing out the unusual flowers and shrubs,
while Uncle Peabody collected his letters and arranged
them in proper sequence. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span> brought out the tea-table
and laid everything in readiness, returning to the
house just in time to usher the dignified figure into the
hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I have not disarranged your plans,&rdquo; apologized
the professor, pleased with the cordiality of his reception.
&ldquo;I had a little experience which delayed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle is so anxious to tell you of some good tidings,
professor, that he has almost become impatient,&rdquo;
replied Helen, smiling. &ldquo;You observe that I say &lsquo;almost,&rsquo;
do you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would never do for him to become impatient, would
it?&rdquo; replied Tesso, turning to his friend&mdash;&ldquo;you the
disciple of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cornaro</span> and the example to us all! But I
myself am weaker&mdash;I admit my impatience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody and Emory drew up the chairs, and
Tesso seated himself next to Mr. Cartwright with obvious
expectancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You recall the results of my own experiments in
attempting to show increased muscular and mental endurance
as a result of eating in right manner what the
appetite selects instead of eating in wrong manner what
the doctors advise?&rdquo; began Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And incidentally demonstrating that the existing
standard of minimum nutrition for man was three times
too large?&rdquo; queried Tesso.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You all were very generous, but I know you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
attributed the results in a measure to my own personal
peculiarities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right to a certain extent,&rdquo; admitted Tesso,
&ldquo;yet, so far as the experiment went, it proved that your
theory was correct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I have further evidence to add which is overwhelming,&rdquo;
continued Uncle Peabody, triumphantly.
&ldquo;For the last six months experiments have been in
progress in America, taking as subjects groups of men
in different walks of life&mdash;college professors, athletes,
and soldiers. To-day I have received a report of the
results. In every instance, on an intake of less than the
recognized minimum standard, the subjects improved in
physical condition and increased their strength efficiency
from twenty-five to one hundred per cent. Think of
that, Tesso&mdash;from twenty-five to one hundred per
cent.!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I congratulate you heartily, my dear friend,&rdquo; replied
the professor, warmly. &ldquo;The effects of this will be most
far-reaching. I foresaw that you might demonstrate a
new minimum, but I had not expected that an increased
efficiency would accompany it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would introduce this discovery of yours
to the Harvard football team,&rdquo; remarked Emory, feelingly.
&ldquo;Perhaps it would result in a few more victories
on the right side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly would help matters,&rdquo; assented Uncle
Peabody, with confidence. &ldquo;All this so-called training
is necessary only because of the abuse which the average
man&rsquo;s stomach suffers from its owner. My theory is that
any man, college athlete or otherwise, can keep in perfect
condition all the time, simply by following a few easy
rules and by knowing how to take care of himself. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
is just as important to be in training for his every-day
life as for an athletic contest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did the experiments result with the athletes?&rdquo;
Emory inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These records are the most interesting of all,&rdquo; replied
Uncle Peabody, referring to his letter. &ldquo;This
group included track athletes, football players, the intercollegiate
all-around champion, and several others&mdash;all
at full training. They had already increased their
strength and endurance efficiency at least twenty-five
per cent during the training period before taking up
the new system. In four months, eating whatever they
craved, but using only the amount demanded by their
appetites and giving it careful treatment in the mouth,
these athletes reduced the amount of their food from one-third
to one-half, and increased their strength and endurance
records from twenty-five to one hundred per
cent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to feel pretty well satisfied with that,&rdquo;
said Emory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody, &ldquo;as far as
it goes, but I hope for far more important results than
these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; queried Professor Tesso. &ldquo;I shared the
thought expressed by Mr. Emory that your ambition
ought now to be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody was silent for a moment. &ldquo;I wonder
if I dare tell you what my whole scheme really is,&rdquo; he
said, at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t startle me any more than you did with
your original proposition three years ago,&rdquo; encouraged
the professor, smiling. &ldquo;At that time I could but consider
you a physiological heretic.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tesso,&rdquo; said Uncle Peabody, deliberately, &ldquo;the results
of these experiments confirm me absolutely that I
am on the right track. These revelations on the subject
of nutrition are but the spokes of the great movement I
have at heart&mdash;or perhaps, more properly speaking, they
are the hub into which the spokes are being fitted. What
I really hope and expect to do is to put education on a
physiological basis, and to demonstrate that it is possible
to cultivate progressive efficiency&mdash;that a man of sixty
ought to be more powerful, physically and intellectually,
than a man of forty. I can see no reason, logically, for
one to retrograde as rapidly as men do now, but this depends
upon his knowing how to run the human engine
intelligently and economically and thus keeping it always
in repair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You astonish me, truly,&rdquo; said Tesso, thoughtfully,
&ldquo;yet I can advance no argument except faulty human
experience to refute your theory. In fact, you yourself
are a living demonstration of its truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there would be no old age?&rdquo; queried Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There would be age just the same,&rdquo; replied Uncle
Peabody, &ldquo;but it would be ripe and natural age, with
only such infirmities as come from accident; and less of
these, since disease would find fewer opportunities to
fasten itself upon its victims. If all the world knew what
some know the death-rate could be cut in two, the average
of human efficiency doubled, and the cost of necessary
sustenance halved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cartwright,&rdquo; said Professor Tesso, impressively,
&ldquo;if you succeed in carrying through this great reform
of yours, even in part, you will be the greatest
benefactor of mankind the world has known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too large a contract to be carried through by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
any single one, but my confidence in the final outcome is
based on the intelligent interest which others are taking
in my work. I am glad you do not think the idea chimerical.
It encourages me to keep at it with tireless application.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dare I interrupt with so prosaic a suggestion as a
cup of tea?&rdquo; asked Helen, as there came a lull in the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cartwright has given me so much to think about
that a little relaxation will be grateful,&rdquo; replied the professor.
&ldquo;Perhaps you would be interested if I gave
you an account of the experience which delayed me this
afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Helen, as she prepared the tea.
&ldquo;I am sure it was an interesting one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may not know that I have a great love for the
romantic,&rdquo; confessed Professor Tesso. &ldquo;It seems a far
cry from my every-day life, but sometime I mean to prepare
an essay upon the subject of the relation between
science and romance. In fact, I believe them to be very
closely allied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a clever idea!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;If you ever
prove that to be true it will explain a lot of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can do it sometime,&rdquo; continued the scientist,
complacently, &ldquo;and in the mean time I gratify
my whim by taking observations whenever the opportunity
offers. To-day I had a most charming illustration,
and I became so much interested that it made me
late in coming to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly have an admirable excuse,&rdquo; assented
his hostess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspect that the objects of my observation are
fellow-patriots of yours, but I am not certain. The man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
was a strong, fine-looking fellow with ability and determination
written clearly in his face. He was evidently
a deep student&mdash;perhaps a professor in some one of
your American colleges. His companion, the heroine of
my story, was a small woman, but so intense! I think
it was her intensity which first attracted my attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure they could not have been Americans, professor,&rdquo;
interrupted Helen. &ldquo;No American woman
would display her emotion like that, I am sure.&mdash;Do
you take cream, and how many lumps of sugar, please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be right, of course,&rdquo; continued Tesso, giving
her the necessary information. &ldquo;In fact, my whole
story is based upon supposition. However, as they sat
there together, first he would say something to her, and
they would look into each other&rsquo;s faces, and then she
would say something to him, and the operation would
be repeated. They spoke little, but the silent communion
of their hearts as they looked at each other spoke more
eloquently than words. It was beautiful to behold.
&lsquo;There,&rsquo; I said to myself, &lsquo;is a perfect union of well-mated
souls. What a pity that they must ever go out
into the world and run the risk of having something
commonplace come between them and their devotion!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;How I wish I might have
been with you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole episode could not have failed to interest
you as it did me.&rdquo; The professor was ingenuously sincere
in his narrative. &ldquo;In these days one so seldom sees
husbands and wives properly matched up. Of course, it
is quite possible that when this pair I speak of are actually
married they will quarrel like cats and dogs. But
for the present their devotion was so natural, so untainted
by the world&rsquo;s actualities, that I confess myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
guilty of having deliberately watched them far beyond
the bounds of common decency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should certainly pursue your investigations
further,&rdquo; said Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;After having discovered
psychological subjects in a man and a woman perfectly
adapted to each other, it would be a pity not to
continue your researches that their perfections might be
recorded for the benefit of others less fortunate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no idea who they were?&rdquo; asked Emory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest. I might have found out, as my
friend, whom I went to see, must know them; but I was
aghast when I discovered the hour, and ran away without
so much as leaving my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did all this happen?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Laurenziana</span>,&rdquo; replied Tesso. &ldquo;I went to
call on my old friend <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>.&rdquo; The professor laughed
guiltily. &ldquo;I hope he never learns the reason why I
failed to keep my appointment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen placed her cup abruptly upon the table and
stared stonily at Tesso. Uncle Peabody and Emory
glanced quickly at each other in absolute helplessness.
The professor, however, failed to notice the effect of his
words upon his auditors; he was too much amused by the
mental picture of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> waiting for him while he, only
a few feet away from the librarian&rsquo;s study, was gratifying
his love for the romantic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I join you?&rdquo; cried a voice behind Helen, as
Inez Thayer approached unnoticed in the dim light.
&ldquo;Mr. Armstrong went down to the station to send a
cable, so I came back alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inez&mdash;Miss Thayer, let me present Professor Tesso,&rdquo;
said Helen, mechanically.</p>

<p>The professor held out his hand and stepped toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
her. As the features of her face became clear a great
joy overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heroine!&rdquo; he cried, turning to the others. &ldquo;This
is the heroine of my story! Now, my dear Mr. Cartwright,
I can record these perfections for the benefit of
others less fortunate!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XVI</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>What happened after Inez arrived, how she
herself had acted, and how Professor Tesso&rsquo;s
departure had been accomplished remained a
blank to Helen. All that was clear to her was the pain&mdash;the
sharp, aching pain&mdash;which came to her with a realization
of the true significance of the story Tesso told.
The crisis was coming fast, Helen was conscious of that;
she even wondered if it was not at hand already.</p>

<p>Throughout the long, sleepless night Helen reviewed
the events of the brief months of her married life. She
even began earlier than that, and recalled those days in
Boston when Jack Armstrong had appeared before her
first as an acquaintance, then as a friend&mdash;sympathetic,
helpful, congenial&mdash;and finally as a suitor for her hand.
As she looked back now the period of friendship was recalled
with the greatest happiness. Perhaps this was because
he had then been more thoughtful of her and less
masterful, perhaps it was because the friendship entailed
less responsibility&mdash;she could not tell. Even during their
engagement she had laughed at those moods which she
had not understood, and he had accepted her attitude
good-naturedly and become himself again. Now she
wondered how she had dared to laugh at him!</p>

<p>Then her mind dwelt upon the ocean voyage&mdash;those
days of cloudless happiness, of unalloyed joy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
visit in Paris, where the sights, although not new, seemed
so different because of the companionship of her husband.
The trip to Florence, the first glimpse of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa
Godilombra</span>&mdash;which was to be their earliest home together&mdash;all
came back to her with vivid distinctness.
And the day at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span>&mdash;that day when her husband
had become a boy again, and had shown her a side of his
nature so unreserved, so natural that she had felt a new
world opening before her, a new happiness, the like of
which she had never known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; she cried, aloud, &ldquo;why could not that
day at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span> have lasted forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still the panorama of reminiscence continued. That
evening when De Peyster, all unconsciously, repeated to
her those words of Inez&rsquo; which first altered the aspect of
her entire world was clearly recalled. Perhaps she might
have prevented the present crisis had she recognized the
danger then and acted upon the information she had unintentionally
received. Perhaps if she had in some way
interfered with the work at the library, and thus prevented
the constant companionship of her husband and
Inez, the trouble might have been averted. But she
would have despised herself had she done that. If she
could hold her husband&rsquo;s love only by preventing him
from meeting other women her happiness had indeed
never been secure.</p>

<p>And she had tried to enter into his life, to understand
this phase of his nature which, after all her efforts, had
baffled her intentions. She had gone to the library with
him, expecting to apply herself to her self-appointed
task until she succeeded in satisfying even so exacting
a master as she knew her husband to be. He would have
been patient with her; he would have appreciated the love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
which prompted her efforts, and all would have been well.
But <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> had interfered. She could hear his voice now;
she could see the expression on his face as he spoke
the words, &ldquo;By not interfering with this character-building,
you, his wife, will later reap rich returns.&rdquo;
Helen laughed bitterly to herself. She was reaping
the rich returns now&mdash;rich in sorrow and pain and
suffering.</p>

<p>Perhaps she could have forced the crisis to come when
Inez&rsquo; confession to De Peyster had been disclosed by
Emory. Jack&rsquo;s conduct at that time had almost brought
Helen&rsquo;s resentment to the breaking-point; but what Inez
had told her afterward had made her feel more in sympathy
with him, even though she understood him no better
than before. &ldquo;Your husband is a god among them
all,&rdquo; Inez had said; &ldquo;you will be so proud of him&mdash;so
proud that he belongs to you.&rdquo; She was proud of him,
but her pride could in no way make up to her for the
loss of his affection. In her mind&rsquo;s eye she could see
him, with his masterpiece completed, receiving the world&rsquo;s
plaudits, but entirely unmindful of her, his wife, who
had stood aside and made it possible for him to accomplish
it all. Oh, it was too cruel, too unfair! Helen
buried her head in the pillows and moaned piteously.</p>

<p>She lived over again that one moment in the automobile,
that one look in her husband&rsquo;s face which had
given her relief. It had, indeed, been a brief respite!
At that moment she felt that Jack&rsquo;s love for her still
existed, strong and deathless, in the face of temporary
abstraction. With this certainty she could endure in
patience whatever sacrifices were necessary to win him
back to herself. But Jack&rsquo;s words to Inez on the steps,
&ldquo;You are the only one who understands me&rdquo;&mdash;there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
could be no mistake there. It was to Inez and not to
her that he turned for understanding and for comfort.</p>

<p>All through the day she had tried to deceive herself
into believing that even this was the result of some mental
illness from which Jack was suffering, but Tesso had
added just the necessary detail to destroy even the semblance
of comfort to which she had so tenaciously clung.
&ldquo;A perfect union of well-mated souls,&rdquo; the professor had
called them. &ldquo;What a pity to have something commonplace
come between them and their devotion!&rdquo; And she
was that &ldquo;commonplace something&rdquo;!</p>

<p>At all events, the main point had been definitely settled.
For weeks she had known that Inez loved Jack;
now she felt sure that this affection must be reciprocated.
She should have known it sooner, she told herself. &ldquo;I
have been such a coward,&rdquo; she said, inwardly&mdash;&ldquo;I could
not bear to know for a certainty what I feared to be
true.&rdquo; Now the worst that could happen had happened.
Jack would in all probability be the last one to suggest
any break. He would keep on as at present with his book&mdash;perhaps
he might extend the work somewhat, in order
to be with Inez a little longer; but when this was completed
he would come back to her again, his obsession
would disappear, and outwardly there would be no
change. They would return to Boston and be received
by their friends with glad acclaim, and with congratulations
upon the happy months of the honey-moon passed
under such congenial conditions! Jack would be an exemplary
husband, she knew that. With the book completed
and away from the overpowering influences which
had controlled him in Florence he would again be to her,
perhaps, all he had ever been. But what an irony it
would be!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Not for a moment did she accuse him of having married
her without believing that he loved her. Armstrong&rsquo;s
sincerity was a characteristic which could never
be denied. He had not known Inez then. Any one
could see that he and Inez were meant for each other;
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> saw it and said so; Tesso saw it and said so; she
herself felt it without a question. Her marriage to Jack
had been a mistake, an awful mistake. If only he and
Inez had met earlier! Her own life was ruined, but was
there any reason why the tragedy should include the
others? If it would help matters Helen might be selfish
enough to let them share the pain, but as there was
nothing to be gained it would be worse than selfish.
Jack had no idea that she was aware of the true conditions.
He would oppose her if she attempted to take it
all into her own life, yet this was the only course to pursue
which could minimize the suffering.</p>

<p>Helen shut her eyes, but sleep was still far distant.
The first agony had not run its course, and it would have
been a misdirected mercy to stem its flow. There was no
resentment in Helen&rsquo;s heart, and at this she herself wondered.
Inez was not to blame for loving Jack&mdash;it was
the most natural thing in the world. She had tried her
best to keep the knowledge of her affection to herself,
and but for the double accident she might have succeeded.
Jack was not to blame. He himself had not
known the strength of the power which drew him back
to Florence, nor could he have foreseen how wholly it
would possess him when once he yielded himself to it.
He had not sought Inez; Helen herself had brought
them together. He had found her useful to him in his
work; he had found her agreeable as a friend; all beyond
that had been a natural growth which could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and perhaps should not have been checked. The more
the pity of it!</p>

<p>At first Helen felt that if Jack could return to his old
self inwardly it would be worth the struggle. Then
she realized that this could never be. The intellectual
strength of her husband had won Helen&rsquo;s profoundest
admiration, even though it was beyond her understanding.
She longed to be able to enter into it and respond
to it as Inez did, yet she felt her limitations. But her
love had increased in its intensity by passing through
the fire. The man she knew now was infinitely stronger
and grander than ever before, and in the light of this
new development of character she questioned whether
her affection would not suffer a shock if Jack were to
become again the man she had known in Boston. This
new self was his real self, and the self which he must be
in order to express his own individuality. It was even
as <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> had said&mdash;character-building had been in
process, bringing to the surface qualities which had lain
dormant perhaps for centuries; but&mdash;and here was where
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s wisdom had been at fault&mdash;this development had
not been for her but for another.</p>

<p>The faint rays of dawn crept in through the lattice
windows of Helen&rsquo;s room before she sank into a restless
sleep. A few hours later Armstrong softly entered the
room before leaving for the library and stood for several
moments looking at his wife&rsquo;s face, in which the lines of
her struggle still left their mark. When he returned to
the hall he met Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I have a word with you?&rdquo; Armstrong asked,
leading the way to the library.</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody acquiesced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen is still asleep,&rdquo; said Armstrong by way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
preliminaries. &ldquo;The girl is overdoing somehow, and she
acts very tired. As I looked at her just now she seemed
ten years older than when we left Boston. Don&rsquo;t you
think she is taking on too many of these social functions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody glanced at Armstrong to make sure
that he was quite sincere. &ldquo;I am glad that you have
noticed it at last,&rdquo; he replied, quietly. &ldquo;I have wondered
that you did not perceive the change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must speak to her about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have not hit on the cause of the change
yet,&rdquo; continued Uncle Peabody, suggestively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else can it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew you well enough to talk frankly with
you, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody was bidding for an opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that means that I have done something
which has not met with your approval.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That answers my question, Jack. I don&rsquo;t know you
well enough, so I will refrain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has it to do with Helen?&rdquo; insisted Armstrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;But what I have
to say is not intended as a reproach. I simply feel that
if you have not already discovered that Helen is a
very unhappy girl it is time some one called your
attention to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong was thoughtful. &ldquo;Do you mean that
Helen is really unhappy, or simply upset over some
specific thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that she is suffering, day after day, without
relief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be wrong,&rdquo; replied Armstrong, decisively.
&ldquo;She was a little hurt over something I said to her night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
before last, and I mean to straighten that out; but if
there was anything beyond that, I should surely have
known of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the last one she would speak to about it,&rdquo;
Uncle Peabody said, gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so mysterious? Perhaps you are referring
to my work at the library. Has Helen been talking
to you about that?&rdquo; Armstrong demanded, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen has said nothing to me, and does not even
know that I have noticed anything,&rdquo; said Uncle Peabody,
emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which shows you how little there is to your fears,&rdquo;
retorted Armstrong, relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to prove anything, Jack,&rdquo; continued
Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;The fact remains, whatever the cause,
that Helen is fast getting herself into a condition where
she will be an easy victim for this accursed Italian malarial
fever. I sound the warning note; I can do no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong was unconvinced. &ldquo;I never looked upon
you as an alarmist before,&rdquo; he replied, glancing at his
watch. &ldquo;I am late for my work this morning, but when
I return I will question Helen carefully and arrive at the
root of the difficulty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you succeed,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody, feelingly.</p>

<p class="r3">Helen came down-stairs in the afternoon and found the
villa deserted. Instinctively she sought the garden, walking
out upon the terrace, where she leaned against one
of the ancient pillars, her gaze extending to the familiar
view of the river and the city beyond. She thought of
the dramas which had been enacted within the walls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the weather-stained palaces whose roofs identified their
location. These had been more spectacular, and had won
their place in history, but she questioned whether they
could have been more tragical than the one she was now
passing through. Surely it was as easy, she told herself,
to meet intrigue and opposition, as to be confronted
with the necessity of decreeing one&rsquo;s own sentence and
then carrying it into execution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&mdash;my husband!&rdquo; her heart again cried out
in its pain. &ldquo;Why did you come into my life, since I
never belonged in yours, only to give me a taste of what
might have been!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her reveries were interrupted by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>&rsquo;s announcement
that the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contessa Morelli</span> was at the door, in her
motor-car. Glad of any diversion, Helen hastened to
welcome her, and returned with her to the garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad to find you in,&rdquo; the contessa remarked,
with evident sincerity, as they seated themselves in the
shade. &ldquo;In the first place, I really wanted to see you,
and, in the second, my dear <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Morelli</span> is in his most aggravating
mood to-day, and we should have come to
blows if I had not run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How unfortunate that your husband suffers so!&rdquo;
Helen replied, sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is unfortunate for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for him, too, I imagine,&rdquo; insisted Helen, smiling.</p>

<p>The contessa was unwilling to yield the point. &ldquo;I
claim all the sympathy,&rdquo; she said, with finality. &ldquo;When
a man has had sixty years of fun in getting the gout, he
has no right to complain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixty years&mdash;&rdquo; began Helen, in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; replied the contessa, complacently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
&ldquo;I belong to the second crop. He was a widower with a
title and position, and I had money; but I must admit
that we were both moderately disappointed. However,
marriage is always a disappointment, and I consider myself
fortunate that things are no worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen felt the color come to her face as the contessa&rsquo;s
words recalled her own sorrow, which for the moment
she had forgotten. The freedom with which her guest
spoke of her personal affairs repelled her, yet there was a
subtle attraction which Helen could not help feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very pessimistic on the subject of marriage,&rdquo;
she ventured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; the contessa insisted, calmly. &ldquo;Husbands
are selfish brutes, all of them; but they are absolutely
necessary to give one respectability. Perhaps
your husband is an exception, but I doubt it. Where
is he now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is at the library,&rdquo; Helen faltered, resenting the
contessa&rsquo;s question, but forced to an answer by the suddenness
with which it was put.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the library?&rdquo; repeated the contessa, interrogatively.
&ldquo;That is where he was on the afternoon of the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Londi</span> reception. Is he there all the time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good deal of the time,&rdquo; admitted Helen. &ldquo;He is
engaged upon an important literary work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In which he takes a great interest and you none at
all. There you have it&mdash;selfishness, the chief attribute
of man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does look like it,&rdquo; Helen answered, concluding
that she had better move in the line of the least resistance.
&ldquo;But in this particular case I am very much
interested in my husband&rsquo;s work, even though I am unable
to enter into it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not interest,&rdquo; corrected the contessa&mdash;&ldquo;it is
sacrifice; and that is woman&rsquo;s chief attribute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you are determined to include my husband in
your general category.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must, because he is a man. But my reason for
doing this is to convince you that it is the thing to be
expected. Unless you learn that lesson early in your
married life, my dear, you will be miserably unhappy.
I am certain that the old Persian proverb, &lsquo;Blessed is
he who expecteth nothing, for he shall not be disappointed,&rsquo;
was written by a woman&mdash;and a married woman at
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s duties at the tea-table aided her to preserve
her composure, but the contessa&rsquo;s matter-of-fact expressions
were not reassuring in the present crisis she was
passing through. She felt herself in no position to combat
her theories, yet not to do so seemed a tacit admission
of all which she strove to conceal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not live with a man such as you describe,&rdquo;
she said, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you could!&rdquo; The contessa laughed at
Helen&rsquo;s innocence and inexperience. &ldquo;That is the way
we all feel when we are first married; but we soon get
over it&mdash;unless there is another woman in the case; then
it is different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do we do in that case?&rdquo; asked Helen, looking
up at her guest with a smile. &ldquo;You may as well prepare
me for any emergency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; the contessa replied, seriously, resting
her elbow upon the little table and returning Helen&rsquo;s
glance&mdash;&ldquo;in that case we try to arouse our husband&rsquo;s
jealousy; but we must do it discreetly, as they are not
so long-suffering as we.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not leave one&rsquo;s husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dear, simple little bride!&rdquo; cried the contessa, indulgently&mdash;&ldquo;and
let him have a clear field? What an
original idea! But how our conversation has run on!&rdquo;
The contessa rose and held out her hand graciously. &ldquo;I
really must be going now; but I wish you and Mr. Armstrong
would take tea with me&mdash;say day after to-morrow.
I want to see this exceptional husband of yours,
and if my dear <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Morelli</span> is not too impossible I will show
him off to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt if Mr. Armstrong will feel that he can spare
the time away from his book&mdash;&rdquo; began Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case, then, come alone. Perhaps we can have
all the better visit by ourselves. I shall expect you.
Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Helen could make any further remonstrance
the contessa had vanished through the hall-door, and a
moment later the car could be heard moving out of the
court-yard. She again leaned against her favorite pillar,
trying to comprehend this new phase of life. Uncle
Peabody found her standing there a few moments later
when he returned from the city. Helen pulled herself
together when she saw him coming, even though she made
no attempt to change her position. Mr. Cartwright
longed to comfort her, but something in the girl&rsquo;s face
told him that the time had not yet come. So he took
his place beside her, and, passing his arm about her
waist, gently drew her toward him. Helen accepted the
caress with the smile which she had learned to use to
conceal the ruffled surface of her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contessa Morelli</span> has just been here,&rdquo; she observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Did you find her entertaining?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I think that just expresses it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;worldly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen laughed. &ldquo;She is certainly worldly. Yet there
is something beneath it all which attracts me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a splendid example of a woman who takes the
world as she finds it,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody continued, seriously.
&ldquo;Most women consider their husbands as material
for idealizing. Then they rub their Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp, set
a train of wishing in operation, and expect their selected
material to live up to the ideals. When the material
proves unworthy, they lose faith in everything instead of
letting their experience educate their ideals. The contessa
has risen above this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet, I judge, her husband has given her plenty of
opportunity to lose her faith,&rdquo; Helen added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody acquiesced. He looked affectionately
at her, and fastened behind her ear a little
strand of hair which had become loose. Then he continued,
half-jocosely, &ldquo;The men I know whom I would
marry if I were a woman are so precious few that I
would certainly be a bachelor maid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen smiled at the expression on Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Is it not good to be here together?&rdquo; she said,
simply. &ldquo;Your visit has meant so much to me, and now
I have been considering a lot of plans which you must
help me to work out. I have been waiting for just the
right time, and now I believe it has come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody was genuinely surprised by Helen&rsquo;s
manner as well as by her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much longer are you going to stay in Florence,
Helen?&rdquo; he asked, pointedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know,&rdquo; she replied, frankly. &ldquo;Our
original plan was to leave early in July; but that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
only about a month from now, and I presume Jack will
require a longer time to complete his work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has not made any definite plans, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and I hope we shall stay at least as long as that.
The things which I have in mind may require even more
time than I suspect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And these things are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You inquisitive old Uncle Peabody!&rdquo; Helen took
his face between her hands as she kissed him affectionately.
&ldquo;I will tell you all in good time, and you shall be
the first to know!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XVII</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>Helen debated with herself long and seriously regarding
the contessa&rsquo;s invitation. As she had said
to Uncle Peabody, her new acquaintance both repelled
and attracted her. Here was a woman who had
undoubtedly passed through far more bitter experiences
than she herself would ever be called upon to endure, yet
was able to rise supremely above them and force from
the world that which she still considered to be her just
due. Helen could not help admiring her for this quality,
and she tried to draw from her example some lessons
which might be applicable to the present situation. At
first she thought of insisting that her husband accompany
her. She felt certain that he would not refuse her
if he really understood that she expected and wished it,
yet she knew without his telling her how distasteful it
would be to him. If they were planning to live in Florence,
it would, of course, be necessary for him to place
himself in evidence, as the contessa had said, for the &ldquo;respectability&rdquo;
of it; but as their life in Italy was so nearly
ended&mdash;as their life together was so nearly ended&mdash;she
felt that there was nothing to be gained in asking
him to make this sacrifice. So Helen decided to return
the contessa&rsquo;s call alone.</p>

<p>Alfonse was waiting for her in the motor-car when
Emory drove into the court-yard. Seeing the machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
he alighted and stepped through the open door into the
hall, where he intercepted her a few moments later when
she came down-stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are just going out?&rdquo; he said, by way of
greeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Phil&mdash;where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of that old picture there,&rdquo; he replied, pointing
to the wall. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I look funny without my ruffles and
knee-breeches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do be serious, Phil,&rdquo; Helen laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am serious. How could I be otherwise when I see
you just going out when I have come all the way up
here to have a quiet little chat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was clearly disturbed. &ldquo;This is really too
bad,&rdquo; she said, trying to think of some plan out of it.
&ldquo;I promised the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contessa Morelli</span> to take tea with her
this afternoon, or I would stay home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contessa Morelli</span>!&rdquo; exclaimed Emory. &ldquo;That
simplifies everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how,&rdquo; Helen remarked, frankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you can take me with you. What could be
easier?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; admitted Helen, meditatively. &ldquo;Why
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any &lsquo;why not,&rsquo;&rdquo; Emory asserted.</p>

<p>The contessa welcomed Helen with open arms. &ldquo;But
this is not your husband!&rdquo; she exclaimed, turning to
Emory before Helen had an opportunity to explain. &ldquo;I
had the pleasure of meeting you at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Londi</span> reception,
did I not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Emory came to call just as I was starting out,&rdquo;
Helen hastened to say, &ldquo;and he begged so hard to be
allowed to see you again that I could not refuse him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So you could not pull your learned husband away
from his books?&rdquo; the contessa queried, after smilingly
accepting Emory&rsquo;s presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not try, contessa,&rdquo; Helen answered, promptly.
&ldquo;He has reached a crisis in his work, and I was unwilling
to suggest anything which might divert his mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an exemplary wife you are! If we all treated
our husbands with such consideration they would become
even more uncontrollable than at present. Don&rsquo;t you
think so, Mr. Emory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The suggestion is so impossible that I can think of
no reply,&rdquo; Emory answered. &ldquo;Mrs. Armstrong is such
an unusual wife as to warrant considering her as an
isolated exception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory spoke with such sincerity that the contessa
looked at him with renewed interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew that to be the case,&rdquo; she said at length, &ldquo;but
I am glad to hear you say it. One so seldom hears a
married woman championed so freely by a friend of the
opposite sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Armstrong needs no champion,&rdquo; Emory hastened
to add, feeling somewhat uncomfortable, for Helen&rsquo;s
sake, over the turn the conversation had taken. &ldquo;But
why should I not be permitted to express my admiration
for you or for her just as I would for a beautiful painting
or any other creation of a lesser artist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because &lsquo;beautiful paintings&rsquo; do not have husbands,&rdquo;
replied the contessa, sagely, smiling at Emory&rsquo;s
compliment.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;BECAUSE &lsquo;BEAUTIFUL PAINTINGS&rsquo; DO NOT POSSESS
HUSBANDS,&rdquo; REPLIED THE CONTESSA, SAGELY</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Since we are speaking of husbands,&rdquo; Helen interrupted,
thinking it time to make her hostess exchange
places with her, &ldquo;you promised me that I should meet
yours this afternoon.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, my dear,&rdquo; the contessa corrected. &ldquo;I said
&lsquo;unless he was impossible,&rsquo; and that is just what he is
to-day. Be thankful that your husband&rsquo;s infirmity takes
the form it does rather than the gout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me something about your villa,&rdquo; suggested
Helen, glancing around her. &ldquo;All these places have
romantic histories, and I am sure that this is no exception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All one has to do in order to forget the romance
with which old Italian houses are invested is to live in
one,&rdquo; the contessa replied. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, they
contain more rheumatism than romance. This one is fairly
livable now, but I wish you could have seen it when
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Morelli</span> first brought me here as a bride! Words can&rsquo;t
express it. An old-fashioned house-cleaning and some
good American dollars make the best antidote I know.
The first point of interest I was shown here was the room
in which the previous <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contessa Morelli</span> died. My ambitions
were along different lines, so I added some modern
improvements, much to the consternation of my husband
and the servants. And the present <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contessa
Morelli</span>, you may have observed, is still very much alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the time the call came to an end Helen and Emory
had learned much regarding Italian life from an American
woman&rsquo;s standpoint, but in the mean time the contessa&rsquo;s
active brain had not been idle. The situation in
which she found her new friends puzzled her somewhat
and interested her more. She had discovered the indifferent
husband and the passive wife&mdash;two necessary elements
in every domestic drama. Emory answered well
enough for the admiring friend of the wife, so all that
was necessary was to find the second woman and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis person</i> would be complete. This would explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the husband&rsquo;s indifference and the wife&rsquo;s passivity.
It was an interesting problem, and the contessa saw
definite possibilities in it.</p>

<p>As Emory and Helen took their leave Phil suggested
that they run down to the library in the motor-car to
pick up Armstrong and Miss Thayer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Thayer?&rdquo; queried the contessa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend, whom you must meet,&rdquo; Helen explained.
&ldquo;She has been with us almost since our arrival, and is
assisting Mr. Armstrong in his literary work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the contessa, beaming as the completeness
of her intuition came to her. &ldquo;How very interesting!
I shall look forward to meeting these two
other members of your family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The machine reached the foot of the hill and slowed
down to pass through the city streets before either
Emory or Helen broke the silence, yet it was evident
that their minds found full employment. The call upon
the contessa left them both with an intangibly unpleasant
sensation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I went with you, Helen,&rdquo; Emory remarked,
after the long pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you did,&rdquo; admitted Helen, frankly, his
words fitting in exactly with her own thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too bad that one can&rsquo;t do or say the natural
thing without having it misunderstood. The contessa
is determined to find something upon which she may
seize as material for gossip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is usually not difficult when one tries hard
enough,&rdquo; Helen agreed; &ldquo;especially when one is living
in such an atmosphere as she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack will have to sacrifice himself temporarily or he
will leave you in an uncomfortable position.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Emory spoke guardedly and watched the effect of his
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would have come this afternoon if I had asked
him,&rdquo; Helen asserted, confidently, &ldquo;but his book is nearly
finished and he is not in a mood to be interrupted. I
don&rsquo;t want anything to interfere with its completion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a relief, though, to have it finished, won&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked up quickly at Emory&rsquo;s question and as
quickly dropped her eyes as they met his. &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes,&rdquo;
she admitted, slowly. &ldquo;I shall be glad to have him
take a little rest. I am sure he has been overdoing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl felt Emory&rsquo;s questioning glance upon her,
and it added to her discomfiture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it is time to let me help you,
Helen?&rdquo; he asked, pointedly. &ldquo;You know perfectly
well that I feel toward you just as I always have. No&rdquo;&mdash;he
stopped the restraining words upon her lips&mdash;&ldquo;I
am going to say nothing which I ought not to say, nothing
which you ought not to hear. But I want you to be
happy, Helen, and sometimes a man can help. Don&rsquo;t be
afraid to ask me; don&rsquo;t let your pride stand between us.
You know that I shall take no advantage of anything
you tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s lips quivered slightly as she listened, but her
voice was natural though restrained. &ldquo;Something is
misleading you, Phil,&rdquo; she answered, calmly. &ldquo;Nothing
has happened to make it necessary for me to ask help
from any one. If there had I should be glad to have so
good a friend to fall back upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are deceiving no one but yourself, Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned quickly toward him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one knows how much you are suffering in
spite of your brave attempt to keep it to yourself. Why
won&rsquo;t you let me help you, Helen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is &lsquo;every one&rsquo;?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;your uncle Peabody and I and&mdash;the contessa,&rdquo;
stammered Emory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and Uncle Peabody think I am suffering?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen held her head very high in the air, and spoke
in a superior tone so obviously assumed as a cloak to
disguise her real feelings, that Emory regretted that he
had forced the subject upon her; but now it had gone
too far to draw back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you know that, perhaps you know the cause of it
as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do. Jack&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Helen commanded. The motor-car turned
into the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza San Lorenzo</span>. &ldquo;If you have anything
to say about my husband,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;you had
better say it direct to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I?&rdquo; cried Emory, leaning forward eagerly.
He looked at Helen steadily for a moment, like a runner
waiting for the pistol-shot to release him from his strained
position at &ldquo;set.&rdquo; The girl returned his look with
equal steadiness for only an instant before she read what
was in his mind. Armstrong and Inez were just coming
out through the cloister gates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I?&rdquo; Emory repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Helen replied, quickly, sinking back against
the cushions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XVIII</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>Armstrong was most enthusiastic when he returned
late the next afternoon, and Miss Thayer&rsquo;s
face reflected his own great satisfaction. The
book was beginning to round into completeness, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>
had placed upon it the stamp of his unqualified approval,
and the author himself had reason to feel well pleased
with the results of his tireless application. Helen watched
the two as they came out into the garden where she
and Uncle Peabody had been visiting. Yes, they were
meant for each other. Helen could see this more plainly
now even than before. Her husband had lost in
weight and in color since he began his work at the library,
but the slighter frame and paler face seemed more
in keeping with the man whom she now knew. Inez
had also changed. The individuality which Helen had
always considered a striking characteristic of her friend
while at school and later was now completely merged
into that of the man beside her. They thought alike,
talked alike, acted alike. That was what Jack preferred
and what he needed, Helen admitted, and she felt a certain
satisfaction that she was at least strong enough to
see and to admit it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to be very happy to-night, Jack.&rdquo; Helen
tried hard to be natural. &ldquo;What pleasant thing has
happened to you to-day?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Armstrong drew up a chair for Inez and seated himself
beside Helen. &ldquo;Nothing in particular,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;except that I begin to see the end of my book in sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; Helen answered, simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose you are.&rdquo; Armstrong spoke pointedly,
looking at Helen with a curious expression on his
face. &ldquo;Yes, I suppose you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen flushed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean it as you have taken
it, Jack,&rdquo; she replied, quietly. &ldquo;It has been a hard
strain on you, and I am glad to know that you can soon
get a change. I think you need it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong still looked at Helen intently. &ldquo;It has
been a strain,&rdquo; he admitted, at length&mdash;&ldquo;a strain on all
of us.&rdquo; Then his face lighted up as of old. &ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>
says the book is a masterpiece, Helen&mdash;do you understand,
a masterpiece. He says it is better than he believed
it possible for me to do; in fact, the best work on
the period which has ever been written. Can you wonder
that I am happy?&rdquo; He turned from Helen to Inez.
&ldquo;And I could never have accomplished it except for the
help of our friend here, who has so unselfishly changed
her plans at my request. You must thank her for me&mdash;for
both of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it mean that your visit to Florence is about at
an end, Jack?&rdquo; asked Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there is much to be done yet,&rdquo; replied Armstrong.
&ldquo;The first draft is nearly finished, and the
material has all been sifted through; but I must go over
the manuscript once more at least, here in this atmosphere,
before returning to Boston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even the Old South Church and Bunker Hill Monument
will seem very modern when you get back home,
won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything will seem modern,&rdquo; Armstrong assented.
&ldquo;I hate to think of leaving Florence, but there is one
thought which makes it easier. Miss Thayer will, of
course, visit us in Boston next winter, and she and I
will then have a chance to do some other work like this
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Armstrong!&rdquo; cried Inez, aghast. &ldquo;I
should not think of that for a moment. Believe me,
Helen, this is the first I have heard of it. It could not
be, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why could it not be?&rdquo; insisted Armstrong, stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will understand when you take time to think
it over,&rdquo; said Inez, picking up her gloves and starting
for the hall. &ldquo;He does not mean it, Helen&mdash;truly he
does not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do mean it,&rdquo; urged Armstrong, as Inez disappeared.
&ldquo;I mean every word of it. She is your most
intimate friend, and what could be more natural than
for her to visit us? Why could it not be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some things in Boston which are as old as
anything you will find in Florence, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong failed to catch the drift of Mr. Cartwright&rsquo;s
remarks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are trying to avoid answering my question,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;To what do you refer that bears at all
upon the present discussion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conventions,&rdquo; said Uncle Peabody, calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conventions!&rdquo; Armstrong repeated the word with
emphasis. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t imagine that I am going to let
local conventions tell me what to do when I get home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine anything,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody.
&ldquo;I was merely stating a fact.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen saw the hot retort upon her husband&rsquo;s lips.
&ldquo;I would not discuss this any more until after dinner,&rdquo;
she said, quietly, as she rose. &ldquo;As Jack says,
it is a perfectly natural thing for Inez to visit
me. It is possible that it can be arranged in some
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Armstrong. &ldquo;I am glad that there is
one sensible person in the party!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to slip his arm around Helen&rsquo;s waist, but she
gently avoided him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;we shall be late if we don&rsquo;t get
ready now. We have too little time as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="r3">After dinner Uncle Peabody and Inez announced their
intention of devoting the evening to letter-writing, so
Helen and Jack found themselves alone together in the
garden. Helen wrapped her shawl closely about her,
wondering at the chill which came over her when she
realized that she was alone with her husband and that
the opportunity for which she had waited was at hand.
She was silent, trying to decide how best to open the
conversation. Her mind was made up at last. If others
had begun to notice the estrangement, it was time that
Jack knew of it, and from her. All doubt, all uncertainty
had vanished.</p>

<p>She looked long at her husband in the dim starlight.
He was so near her, yet how far away he really was!
Even he did not realize how far. She could see the lines
of his face lighted by his cigar as he silently smoked it,
his eyes fixed upon the lights of the city beyond. How
strong it was, Helen thought, how strong he was compared
with her own weak self! She wondered what his
thoughts were centred upon&mdash;whether on his masterpiece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
or upon Inez! Upon Inez! That brought her back to
the task before her.</p>

<p>It was a difficult task; she realized that. There could
be no immediate separation, for that would mean an interruption
to the work. She must stay in Florence until
the manuscript was completed or Inez could not remain.
No, there must not be any break between Jack and herself
for the present, or his mind would be taken from
his book and another failure added to the great one in
which she felt herself to be the most concerned. Yet she
must make him understand that she was not dull to the
signs which she and the others could but read. To continue
to act as if ignorant of them would be the worst of
all. She must remain his wife until his supreme effort
was accomplished, then the living lie could be ended and
the new and separate life begun.</p>

<p>Armstrong interrupted her reverie before it had quite
come to an end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not looking like yourself lately, Helen,&rdquo; he
said, abruptly. &ldquo;I meant to have spoken of it before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen started at the suddenness of his remark. &ldquo;Not
looking like myself?&rdquo; she repeated, mechanically. &ldquo;How
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look tired and worn out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am getting older, Jack,&rdquo; Helen smiled, sadly.
&ldquo;Perhaps that is what you have noticed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; replied Armstrong. &ldquo;You used to be so
bright and vivacious, and now you sit around and hardly
say a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not answer for a moment. &ldquo;I did not realize
that I had become such poor company, Jack. You have
not seemed interested lately in the things I would naturally
talk about, and of course a great deal of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
conversation is upon subjects with which I am unfamiliar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quite sure that you are not getting too tired
going to all these social functions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite sure. If you stop to think a moment, these
are really the only entertainment I get. Would you prefer
that I stayed here at the villa alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no; unless you are doing too much of that
sort of thing. Are you feeling perfectly well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen hardly knew what to reply. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, at
length, &ldquo;I am feeling perfectly well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong showed his relief. &ldquo;I told Uncle Peabody
he was an alarmist,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Uncle Peabody say?&rdquo; queried Helen,
straightening up, Emory&rsquo;s remarks coming back to her.
&ldquo;I did not know that you and he had been discussing
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said that you were unhappy, and fast becoming
a fit subject for Italian malaria. He had better stick to
his specialty, and not try to become a general practitioner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Helen, relieved that she had not been anticipated,
and resuming her former position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he was as mistaken about your being unhappy
as he was about your being ill,&rdquo; Armstrong continued,
his remark being half assertion and half question.</p>

<p>Helen made no response. He waited a moment or two,
glancing at her furtively, and then put his question more
directly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not unhappy, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen tried to fathom the motive which underlay this
question. At last Jack had become conscious of the fact
that he had hurt her and was endeavoring to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
amends. This was like him; what he had said and done
during the weeks past was not like him. Now something
which Uncle Peabody had said had brought him to himself
again. He saw a duty to perform, and he assumed
it conscientiously; but it was an act of duty rather than
an act of love&mdash;she felt that in every word he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jack,&rdquo; she finally admitted, &ldquo;I am very unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong was annoyed. &ldquo;I really thought you were
stronger, Helen,&rdquo; he said, petulantly. &ldquo;It is all over
this library work, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not strong,&rdquo; replied Helen, quietly. &ldquo;That is
where the whole trouble lies. I am wofully weak, and
I only wish that you and I had discovered it sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would that have helped matters any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we had discovered it before we were married it
would have helped matters a great deal,&rdquo; said Helen,
with decision. &ldquo;As we did not do that we must accept
things as they are until we can find a solution of the
problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have offered time and again to give up my work;
now it has reached a point where I simply must finish
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you must; I should be the first to oppose
you were you to suggest anything different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why are you unhappy? I don&rsquo;t understand
you at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t, and you understand yourself just
as little. The work you are doing is simply an incident;
the results of that work in making you an entirely different
man is the main point. Do you not feel that yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that is it,&rdquo; replied Armstrong. &ldquo;The work has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
made a different man of me, and you object to the
change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is not the change which has made me unhappy.
During these weeks you have become infinitely
bigger and stronger and grander, and I admire you just
that much the more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why are you unhappy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&rdquo;&mdash;Helen choked down a little sob&mdash;&ldquo;because,
as you say, I am so weak. Because it has left me
just that much behind, and has shown me how little suited
I am to be your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you do magnify things!&rdquo; exclaimed Armstrong.
&ldquo;It is not an uncommon thing for a husband to have
interests apart from his wife; it is no reflection on the
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how much better&mdash;how much more helpful&mdash;if
the husband and the wife can share the same interests?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granted. But why suggest a modern miracle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has shown me another thing,&rdquo; Helen continued,
fearful lest she should be diverted from her main theme.
&ldquo;Inez is already much more to you than I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong sprang to his feet, with difficulty holding
back the angry words upon his lips. &ldquo;This is going too
far, Helen,&rdquo; he said, with forced calm. &ldquo;Do you realize
that you are actually making an accusation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen regarded him calmly but sadly. &ldquo;I am making
no accusation,&rdquo; she said, quietly. &ldquo;I believe in your
loyalty to me and in your sense of what is right, but the
fact remains. Inez loves you, and has loved you almost
since the day she arrived. Is it possible that you are
insensible to this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must stop!&rdquo; expostulated Armstrong. &ldquo;You
cannot realize what you are saying!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember what she told Ferdy De Peyster&mdash;&lsquo;I
love him better than my life&rsquo;? Do you remember
the scene at the table when Phil Emory spoke of it and
her reply? Have you been with her day after day without
discovering that she worships the very ground you
walk on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be useless to try to answer you, Helen,&rdquo;
Armstrong replied, forcefully. &ldquo;The most generous
view I can take of what you say is to attribute it to a
jealousy as unfounded as it is unworthy of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Jack, if you only knew!&rdquo; Helen looked at him
reproachfully. &ldquo;There is no jealousy in my heart even
now, my husband, nothing but the greatest admiration
and the deepest love. Sometime you will understand.
You have a great career before you&mdash;greater, perhaps,
than I can realize, because I know of your work only
through others. This career is one which I must not
injure, which I shall not limit. Inez can help you
in attaining it, and it is right that she should do
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s curiosity gained the better of his resentment.
&ldquo;What do you propose to do to bring all this
about?&rdquo; he asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever may be necessary,&rdquo; Helen replied, looking
at him firmly, &ldquo;even though it breaks my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you have not suggested any of this nonsense
to Miss Thayer?&rdquo; Armstrong asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not talked with her about it,&rdquo; replied Helen,
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is to be placed to your credit, at all events.
Miss Thayer has no more sentiment toward me of the
kind you suggest than if she had never met me. She is
the best kind of a friend and a most valuable assistant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
but that is all. My feelings toward her are exactly the
same&mdash;no more, no less. I beg of you not to let anything
so absurdly improbable stand between us now or
later. Come, we had better go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for me,&rdquo; Helen answered, wearily. &ldquo;I
will stay here a while longer. The cool air feels very
grateful to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong left her there, alone with the stars and her
thoughts. The break was made. They had stood at the
parting of the ways, and Helen had pointed out to him
the path which she knew she could not travel with him.
He, with all his strength of mind, had left her without
realizing what had happened. Helen had not expected
him to understand her motive&mdash;that must come later&mdash;but
she had thought that he would at least appreciate
what she had said. Perhaps it was better so. She had
known that he would disclaim the affection which she
felt he could but entertain toward Inez; she was certain
that he himself did not yet appreciate how firmly installed
his &ldquo;sister worker&rdquo; had become in his heart. But
Helen was no less convinced that she was right. Jack
would realize it soon enough, and then he would know
what she had really done to make it easier for him. Perhaps
this was better, too.</p>

<p>The storm was over, and Helen remained as the
weather-beaten evidence that it had taken place. Exhausted
both in mind and body, she lay back in her
chair, with her eyes wide open, her thoughts rushing
madly to and fro seeking a new anchorage. She must
keep her strength for the ordeal yet before her. She
must play her part through to the end without wavering,
or what she had already endured would be of no avail.
So at last she bade good-night to the stars which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
been her silent companions and entered the house. Mechanically
she fastened the veranda shutters and went
up-stairs to her room, closing the door to the world outside,
with which she felt she must become acquainted
anew as she pursued her chosen path&mdash;alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XIX</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>The contessa found herself eager to continue her
inquiries along the new lines which had so clearly
indicated themselves during the conversation with
Mrs. Armstrong and Emory. This desire was by no
means malicious, for those very attributes which attracted
Helen to her would have contradicted anything so
really reprehensible, even as a counter-irritant. In the
contessa&rsquo;s life, filled as it was with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> in spite of her
heroic efforts to enliven it with excitement, gossip and
a bit of scandal acted as agreeable and much-needed
stimulants. She may never have put this thought into
words any more than the man does who depends upon
his modest tipple to give zest to his daily routine; yet,
like him, she found her dependence upon her stimulant
growing slowly yet steadily as the days advanced
and the &ldquo;dear <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Morelli</span>&rdquo; became more and more &ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;
In the present instance the interval since
the last spicy episode had been longer than usual, and
the contessa felt a thrill of enthusiastic delight replace
the dull apathy which she had lately experienced, even
at the suggestion of the conditions as she thought she
saw them. It was a problem which offered her the joy
of solution rather than merely a curiosity to learn more
of the various factors which entered into it.</p>

<p>She liked Helen from the first moment of their meeting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
America often seemed far away to the contessa,
and her new acquaintance brought it nearer to her; but
beyond this Helen proved in herself to be more than ordinarily
interesting. The contessa had known women as
beautiful as Mrs. Armstrong, she had known women who
carried themselves with equal self-confidence and independence;
but never had she seen these combined with
such lofty ideals actually maintained. Her early impression
that Helen&rsquo;s idealism was the result of innocence
was soon corrected. In the school of experience there
are taught two branches in which every clever woman of
the world must perfect herself&mdash;character-reading and
the gentle art of self-defence; both are absolutely essential
to her success. Men underestimate their importance,
and thus develop them to a lesser degree; as a result,
the woman&rsquo;s intuitive reading of character is as
much more delicate and subtle as is her practise of self-defence,
and to a similar extent more effective. Amlie
was a medal pupil in both these branches, and her instinctive
exercise of the first told her that she had discovered
an unusual personality among conditions which
under ordinary circumstances would work out along but
one line. This solution was not in keeping with what
she had read in Helen&rsquo;s character, and she wondered
how the conditions themselves had come to exist. The
contessa hummed cheerily to herself as she moved about
the villa the next morning, and the servants took it for
granted that their master&rsquo;s malady had taken a more
decided turn for the worse.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the contessa&rsquo;s motor-car drew up before
the entrance to the Laurentian Library. The custodian
at the gate took her card, and presently returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>announcing that the librarian was in his study. The
name of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Morelli</span> was well known to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, who had assisted
the count upon several occasions before his marriage
in disposing of some of the rare volumes which had
once been a part of his grandfather&rsquo;s splendid collection.
The librarian had even casually met the new contessa
once or twice, but this was the first time she had honored
him with a call, and he wondered what her errand might
be. Possibly it was her desire to dispose of other volumes;
perhaps it was to protest against further despoliation;
at all events he would be guarded in his conversation
until her object was disclosed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to the halls of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Medici</span>!&rdquo; exclaimed
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, cordially, rising to greet his visitor as she appeared
in the doorway.</p>

<p>The contessa smiled so radiantly in acknowledging his
salutation that the librarian was convinced that his first
hypothesis must be correct. &ldquo;You are surprised to see
me,&rdquo; she remarked, seating herself with deliberation and
looking across at her host with a friendly air. &ldquo;You
may as well admit it, for I can read it in your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both surprised and pleased, contessa,&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> answered,
maintaining his guarded attitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your surprise should be that I have not been here
before,&rdquo; Amlie continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The old man held up his hand with a deprecatory
gesture. &ldquo;You society women have so much to
divert you otherwise that I could scarcely expect, even
with the wonderful books I have here, to prove a magnet
sufficiently strong to draw you away from your customary
pursuits. And your husband has so many splendid
volumes in your own library that these here can hardly
prove a novelty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is about these volumes that I came to see you.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> smiled sagely, feeling pleased at his intuition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have some splendid old volumes, as you say,&rdquo;
the contessa continued. &ldquo;I have looked them all over
and have tried to study them, but beyond my admiration
for their beauty I must admit that I can&rsquo;t make much
out of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are really interested in the books themselves!&rdquo;
exclaimed the librarian, his pleasure increasing
with the prospect of securing a new convert. &ldquo;This is
delightful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; The contessa raised her eyebrows with
well-feigned surprise. She was entirely satisfied with her
progress thus far. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t need to tell you that
my interest is not a very intelligent one. I tried to get
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Morelli</span> to tell me something about them once, but he
doesn&rsquo;t know a book of hours from a missal, so I promised
myself the pleasure of learning from you, if you were
willing to teach me. Are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contessa was fond of punctuating her conversation
with sharp interrogations, but in the present instance
the expression upon <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s face made any
question unnecessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the happiest year I have known since I first
made my home among these books, my daughter,&rdquo; he replied,
with much feeling. &ldquo;For a long time I felt as a
miser must feel surrounded by his gold, far more in
quantity than he can ever count, yet separated by its
overwhelming value from the world outside. My loneliness
came, of course, from another cause&mdash;I craved the
opportunity to share my treasures, yet this opportunity
came but rarely. Patiently have I waited, marvelling
that so few should even know that these treasures exist,
and a lesser number should care to partake of what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
offered to them freely in as large quantities as they are
able to carry away. Year by year I have watched the
number increase, I have seen the signs of a veritable
renaissance; and as one after another comes to me, as you
have this afternoon, my heart fills with an unspeakable
joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sincerity of the old man penetrated through even
the contessa&rsquo;s worldly armor, but the problem she had set
herself to solve was too fascinating to be laid aside. The
librarian need never know how much less interest she felt
in books than in her present undertaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So this year has crowned your labors,&rdquo; she replied,
sympathetically. &ldquo;I do not wonder that you feel gratified!
You have had a greater number of converts, you
say, most of whom, I presume, come from the libraries
and universities near by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; contradicted <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, eagerly. &ldquo;They
come from England, from France, from Germany&mdash;and
even from your own far-off country, contessa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Amlie smiled at the air of triumph with
which the librarian uttered the last words. &ldquo;From
America? Have my countrymen really discovered what
rich mines of learning are here in Florence?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> nodded his head and drew his chair closer to
hers. &ldquo;At this very moment there are two Americans
working here in the library who have so assimilated the
learning of the past that they have become a part of it
themselves. I have had many students here during all
these years, but never any one who was able so completely
to carry out my ideas of modern intellectual expression.
What they have done and are doing has given me
courage to believe that I am not so much of a visionary
as my colleagues think. If by my influence I can produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
two such modern humanists my labors will not have
been in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are these two wonderful men from some library or
university in America?&rdquo; the contessa asked, with apparent
innocence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not,&rdquo; replied the librarian, with emphasis.
&ldquo;If they were they would have come here, as the others
have, with preconceived ideas which centuries could not
break down. One of them is a young advocate from Boston,
and the other&mdash;you will scarcely believe me&mdash;is a
young woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; The contessa manifested an interest not
wholly assumed. &ldquo;A young woman, you say&mdash;his wife,
perhaps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, simply a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Amlie smiled knowingly. &ldquo;Then perhaps
soon to be his wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wrong again, contessa,&rdquo; replied <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>.
&ldquo;The man is already married, so that could hardly be
the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his wife makes no objections? Come, come,
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">monsignore</span>, that would not be human.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His wife is as remarkable in her way as he is in his,&rdquo;
the old man answered, with confidence. &ldquo;We have discussed
the matter, and she understands the importance
of allowing the work to go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she has raised some objections? Do tell me
that she has or I shall find it difficult to believe your
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did suggest that she would have liked to be able
to do this work with her husband, but that was quite out
of the question, and she saw it just as I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very, very interesting!&rdquo; the contessa remarked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
more to herself than to him. &ldquo;I wish I might see them
at work.&rdquo; The librarian hesitated, and Amlie knew
that hesitation is consent if promptly followed up. &ldquo;I
will promise not to disturb them,&rdquo; she urged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not wish them to know that I was exhibiting
them to my friends,&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> said, doubtfully. &ldquo;Still, I
can see no harm unless we disturb them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come!&rdquo; Amlie exclaimed, rising quickly lest
the old man change his mind. &ldquo;I will be as still as a
mouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> led the way to the little alcove which Armstrong
and Inez had come to regard as a part of themselves.
Motioning to the contessa, he pointed out a place beside
an ancient book-shelf where she could observe without
herself being seen. Amlie studied the faces before her
carefully. Armstrong was so seated that only his profile
was visible, but Inez sat so squarely in front of
her that had she not been so engrossed in her labors
she could hardly have avoided seeing the contessa. It
was the girl&rsquo;s face which first held Amlie&rsquo;s attention.
In it she read all that Inez had fought so hard to conceal.
She had found the second woman! It was not the
usual type, she told herself. The passionate devotion to
its given object was there, but it was evidently absolutely
controlled by the intellectual. How much more interesting,
the contessa thought, but how much more dangerous!</p>

<p>Then she turned her attention to Armstrong. He was
younger than she had expected and his personality far
more attractive. The height of his forehead, the depth
of his eye, the strength of his mouth were all carefully
noted. The contessa watched every movement, every
change in the expression, with the keenest delight. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
were an interesting pair, she admitted, but even her
astuteness, she was forced to confess, was unequal to
the task of understanding their relations without further
study. The problem was as new as it was fascinating,
and the contessa had no misgivings over her little plot,
which had worked out so successfully.</p>

<p>She followed the librarian quietly back to his study,
where she made an appointment for him to examine with
her the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Morelli</span> collection and to point out to her the
merits of the various volumes. She expressed her thanks
for the charming afternoon he had given her, but
through it all, and even after she returned to her villa,
the faces of Armstrong and Inez were still before her.
Beneath that abstraction which the man&rsquo;s face and manner
so clearly portrayed, was there a response to the
woman&rsquo;s passionate adoration? Was he capable of affection,
or had the intellectual so far claimed the ascendency
that the physical had, for the time being at
least, become so subdued as practically to be eliminated?
Where did the wife, who had so attracted her, come in?
These were some of the questions over which the contessa
pondered. The problem was more complex than she anticipated,
and she found herself even more determined to
carry it through to a solution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XX</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>A week passed by with little outward change at the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span>. For a day or two after their interview
in the garden Armstrong watched his wife
carefully, but as there was apparently no difference in
her attitude toward him or toward Miss Thayer he decided
that what she had said at that time was the result
merely of a momentary mood which had since passed
away. He also watched Miss Thayer, to satisfy himself
in regard to the monstrous suggestion Helen had made
that she was in love with him, and became convinced
that his own explanation of her feelings toward him was
correct. Having settled these two important matters to
his entire satisfaction, he promptly discarded them from
his mind and devoted himself to the single purpose of
completing his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once let me get this finished,&rdquo; he said to himself,
&ldquo;and Helen will see that there is nothing between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Inez had not been pleased with
Armstrong&rsquo;s suggestion to Helen that she should take
up with him a similar kind of work in Boston. For
the first time since she had known him he had done
something which annoyed her. She realized better than
any one else the absorption which held him subject to
a different code of conventions, but this did not give
him a right to assume that she would accept such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
arrangement, without at least raising the question with
her. Helen and Mr. Cartwright could but think that
the matter had already been discussed between them, and
it placed her in a false light at a time when she felt that
her position was sufficiently untenable without this unfair
and unnecessary addition. She also realized, as
Armstrong apparently did not even after Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s
pointed remarks, that this daily companionship
would be entirely impossible.</p>

<p>During those few days, therefore, when Armstrong
was observing her, she was in a mood quite at variance
with what Helen had described; but what had wounded
her in one respect proved to be a salve in another. Had
Armstrong been conscious of her affection for him, or
had he himself reciprocated it, the request would never
have been made. She was quite safe, therefore, to continue
on until the book was finished, and the danger lay,
as she had told her conscience, only with herself. And
even with this annoyance, which, after all, was but an
incident, she felt it to be her only happiness to stay beside
him as long as she could. She dreaded the time
when the break must come, for she saw no light beyond
that point.</p>

<p>Helen had herself well in hand. She was conscious of
Jack&rsquo;s scrutiny, and was also conscious of the relaxing
of his watchfulness. She saw his new interest in Inez,
and was equally conscious of her friend&rsquo;s unusual frame
of mind. Everything seemed to Helen to be intensified
to such a degree that she could read all that was passing
in the minds of those about her, and she wondered if
some new power had been given her to make her test the
harder. She had already felt the force of the blow; the
others had it still before them. And it would be a blow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
at least to Jack, she was sure&mdash;not so hard a one as in
her own case, for after the pain of the break there was
for him happiness and serenity; but he had cared for
her, and when he once came to a realization of what must
be he would suffer, too. This was her only consolation.</p>

<p>Naturally, Helen turned to Uncle Peabody. Now that
all was settled, it was better that he should know from
her how matters stood rather than surmise as he and
Emory had done; and besides this, the burden had become
too heavy to be borne alone. She waited a few
days for the right opportunity, which came during a
morning walk along the ancient road above the villa
which led to the highest point of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Settignano</span>. They had
left the frequented part of the path behind them, and
were strolling among the rocks and trees of the little
plateau commanding a view of the panorama on either
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could find out from Jack how much longer
you are to remain in Florence,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody said.
&ldquo;I really need to get back to my work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, quickly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go
yet. I need you so much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody regarded his niece critically. There
was a new note in her voice, and it pained him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be much longer, uncle,&rdquo; Helen continued.
&ldquo;I need you here, and I may want you to go back home
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not do that, Helen; but of course I will
stay here as long as you really need me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you would go back with me if I needed that, too,
would you not?&rdquo; insisted Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you needed me, yes; but I can&rsquo;t imagine any such
necessity.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be so hard to go home alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s voice sank almost to a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; echoed Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;Is Jack going to
stay over here and send you back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Jack is going to do, but I shall
return home as soon as his book is completed; and unless
you go with me I shall go alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody understood. &ldquo;My dear, dear child,&rdquo;
he said, taking her hand in his and pressing it sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, please.&rdquo; Helen gently withdrew her hand.
&ldquo;If you do that I shall become completely unnerved.
Let us return to the villa; I really want to talk with you
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The short walk home was accomplished in silence. As
they entered the hallway Uncle Peabody was the first to
speak. &ldquo;Where shall we go?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my &lsquo;snuggery,&rsquo;&rdquo; Helen answered. &ldquo;There we
are sure not to be interrupted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now tell me all about it,&rdquo; he urged, as they seated
themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I imagine you know a good deal about the situation
without my telling you,&rdquo; began Helen, bravely; &ldquo;but
I want you to know the whole story. Otherwise you can&rsquo;t
help me, and without your aid I am absolutely alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know well that you can depend upon that,&rdquo; he
interrupted.</p>

<p>Helen moved nearer and passed her hand through
his arm. &ldquo;We have made a horrible mistake, Jack and
I,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We are not at all suited to each other,
and never should have married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a pretty serious statement,&rdquo; replied Uncle
Peabody.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; assented Helen; &ldquo;but the fact itself is
even more serious. Tell me, do you not see that Jack
is a very different man from the one you first met
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There can be no question about
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this change was but a passing mood it would not
be so serious,&rdquo; continued Helen, &ldquo;but the Jack I know
now is the real Jack, and as such our interests are entirely
apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But all this may correct itself,&rdquo; suggested Uncle
Peabody. &ldquo;Why not get him away from the influences
which have produced this change and see if that will not
straighten matters out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was thoughtful for a moment. &ldquo;That would
never do,&rdquo; she said, at length. &ldquo;You see, there is another
consideration which enters in. Inez and Jack are in love
with each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Jack admitted this?&rdquo; demanded Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>Helen smiled sadly. &ldquo;No; he would never admit it,
even if he knew it to be true. At present his affection is
wholly centered upon his book, and he himself has no
real conception of how matters stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do you feel so certain? I think you are
right about Miss Thayer, but I have seen nothing to
criticise in Jack&rsquo;s conduct except this complete subjugation
to his work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been watching it for weeks, uncle, and I know
that I am right. The old Jack&mdash;the Jack I married&mdash;found
in me the response he craved; but to the new Jack&mdash;the
real Jack&mdash;I can give nothing. Inez is his counterpart;
Inez is the woman who can talk his language
and live his life&mdash;not I.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no reason why you could not do this if he
gave you the chance,&rdquo; he asserted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first it was my fault that I did not make the
effort when he did give me the chance. Then I tried to
enter into it&mdash;you remember the day I went to the library&mdash;but
it was too late. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> showed me how hopeless
it was. Then you remember Professor Tesso&rsquo;s story.
He was right; they are absolutely suited to each other.
It is useless to fight against it and thus increase the
misery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are not going to fight against it, what are
you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to right the wrong in the only way which
remains,&rdquo; replied Helen, firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it yet.&rdquo; Uncle Peabody showed his perplexity.
&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack and I must be separated just as soon as it can
be arranged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody placed his hands upon her shoulders
and looked into her eyes. With all the advance signals
of the storm which he had noted he was unprepared for
this climax. &ldquo;Surely that point has not yet arrived,
Helen,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Those whom God hath joined
together&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just the point,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Those
whom God joins together are those who are suited to each
other. When it becomes evident that two people have
been married who are unsuited, it is also evident that
God never joined them together, and that they ought
not to stay together. That is the case with Jack and
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you told Jack your decision?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in so many words, but in substance. He does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
not appreciate the situation at all, and he won&rsquo;t until the
book is finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go home for a while and see what
happens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I went away now Inez would have to leave, and
that would interrupt the work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t follow you, Helen. One moment you speak
of the misery this work has brought to you, and the next
moment you can&rsquo;t do something because it will interfere
with the very work which you would like to stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to be my fate not to be able to make myself
understood,&rdquo; Helen replied, wearily. &ldquo;Let me try again.
I have no desire to stop the work. It is a necessary part
of Jack&rsquo;s development, and it will open up a great future
for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to continue this means to continue the intimacy
between him and Miss Thayer,&rdquo; insisted Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no desire to stop that, either.&rdquo; Helen was
calm and firm in her replies. &ldquo;It would be no satisfaction
to hold Jack to me when I know perfectly well
that duty and marriage vows remain as the only ties.
It breaks my heart that all this has happened, but
neither the work itself nor even Inez is responsible.
The other side of Jack was like an undeveloped negative&mdash;these
are simply the mediums which have brought out
the picture which was already there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not in a condition to consider this matter
as you should, Helen,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody replied, hardly
knowing what to say. &ldquo;The whole affair has been preying
on your mind for so long that you are arriving at
conclusions which may or may not be justified. Your
very calmness shows that you do not appreciate the seriousness
of your suggestions.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen looked at Uncle Peabody reproachfully.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me think that men are wilfully obtuse,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;When I talked it over with Jack he called
it jealousy; now you think I lack an appreciation of the
seriousness of it all!&rdquo; Helen paused for a moment and
closed her eyes. When she spoke again all the intensity
of her nature burst forth. &ldquo;Can you not see beneath
this calmness the effort I am making to do my duty?&rdquo;
she asked, in a low, tense voice. &ldquo;Can you not see my
heart burned to ashes by the fire it has passed through?
Look at me, uncle. Jack says I seem ten years older&mdash;twenty
would be nearer the truth. Do these changes
come to those who fail to appreciate what they are doing?
It is not that I don&rsquo;t realize; it is because I can&rsquo;t
forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me, child,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody
hastened to say, appalled by the effect of his words.
&ldquo;My own heart has bled for you all these weeks, and I
would be the last to add another burden to the load you
bear. It is hard to suffer, but sometimes I think it is
almost as hard to see those one loves passing through an
ordeal which he is powerless to lighten. I don&rsquo;t want you
to take a step which will plunge you into deeper sorrow,
that is all. You may be right, but I pray God that
you are wrong. Now let me help you, if I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen smiled through the mist before her eyes. &ldquo;You
can help me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;just by being your own dear
self during these hard weeks to come. Stay here until
it is over, and then take me home, where you can show
me how to use the years I see before me.&rdquo; Helen buried
her face in her hands. &ldquo;Oh, those years!&rdquo; she cried;
&ldquo;how can I endure them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Helen,&rdquo; urged Uncle Peabody, kindly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that the world has all gone wrong, as
you think it has. Let us take one step at a time, and see
if together we can&rsquo;t find the sun shining through the
cypress-trees. Tell me just what you propose to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The programme is a simple one,&rdquo; Helen answered.
&ldquo;Outwardly there will be no change. I shall make Jack&rsquo;s
home as attractive as possible to him while we share
it together. Inez is my guest, and will be welcome as
long as I am here. Other than this it will be as if we
all were visitors. Jack will notice no difference while
his work lasts. Then when it is completed you and I
will go back home. Jack may stay here or return, as
he chooses. Inez will decide her own course. Then Jack
will at last understand that I meant what I said&mdash;that
I saw that I stood in the way of his future and stepped
aside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you imagine that he will permit this when once
he understands?&rdquo; asked Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will try to prevent it,&rdquo; assented Helen. &ldquo;He
will realize that he has neglected me and he will want to
atone, but this will be from a sense of duty, even though
he does not know it. The actual break will be a blow to
him, but then he will turn to Inez and will find that I
understood him better than he did himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is counting on continuing this work in Boston
next winter. He spoke of it again yesterday, and
said how splendid it was of you to make it possible for
Miss Thayer to work there with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen rose and stepped out into the garden, looking
far away into the distance. Then she turned toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am making it possible, am I not?&rdquo; she said, simply.</p>

<p>And the lump in Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s throat told him that
he understood at last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XXI</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>The evening had arrived for the reception at
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span> by which Helen was to acknowledge
the many social obligations laid upon her by
her friends in Florence. In the details of preparation
she had found temporary relief from her ever-present
burden, with Uncle Peabody assuming the rle of general
adviser, comforter, and prop. Together they had
worked out the list of guests; together they had planned
the many little surprises which should make the event
unique. Much to old <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>&rsquo;s disgust, his own flowers
were found to be inadequate, and to his camellias, lilies,
oleanders, and roses was added a profusion of those rare
orchids which bear witness that the City of Flowers is
well named. Emory was also pressed into service as the
day drew near, and his energy was untiring in carrying
out the ideas of his superior officers and in suggesting
original ones of his own.</p>

<p>Armstrong had expressed his willingness to co-operate,
but was obviously relieved to find his services unnecessary.
He had reached a crisis in his work, he explained, and if
he really was not needed it would hasten the conclusion
of his labors if they might be uninterrupted at this
particular point. Inez had also offered her aid, but
Armstrong insisted that she could not be spared unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
her presence at the villa was absolutely demanded. So
the work upon the masterpiece had proceeded without a
break, while little by little the plans for the reception
matured.</p>

<p>The novelty of the preparations consisted principally
in the electrical and the floral displays. Uncle Peabody
succeeded in having a number of wires run from the
trolley-line into the villa and the garden, leaving Emory
to plan an arrangement of lights which did credit to
the limited number of electrical courses which his college
curriculum had contained. The grotto was lighted
by fascinating little incandescent lamps, which shed their
rays dimly through the guarding cypresses but full
upon the varicolored shells and stones. Along the top
of the retaining wall, and scattered here and there at
uneven distances and heights among the trees and the
statues, the lights looked like a swarm of magnificent
fire-flies resting, for the time, wherever they happened to
alight. But Emory&rsquo;s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pice de rsistance</i> was the fountain,
beneath the spray of which he had helped the electrician
to fashion a brilliant <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</span> in compliment to
the city of their adoption.</p>

<p>This final triumph was brought to a successful conclusion
almost simultaneously with the cessation of
Helen&rsquo;s labors in transforming the dining-room, the
hallway, and the verandas into veritable flower arbors.
Old <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> and the florist&rsquo;s men had accomplished
wonders under Helen&rsquo;s guidance, and they approved the
final result as enthusiastically as they had opposed the
scheme at first, when Helen had insisted upon a departure
from the conventional &ldquo;set pieces&rdquo; which they tried
to urge upon her. Realizing that the time was approaching
for the light repast, and glad of a respite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Helen wandered out to the garden where Emory and
Uncle Peabody, hand in hand, were executing an hilarious
dance around the fountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world&mdash;&rdquo; began Helen, in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is great, is it not, Mr. Cartwright?&rdquo; cried Emory,
ceasing his evolutions and turning to Uncle Peabody.
&ldquo;This settles it; I am going home on the next steamer
and set myself up as an electrical engineer&mdash;specialty,
decoration of Italian gardens. Watch, Helen&mdash;I will
turn on the lights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant the flitting insects were flickering
throughout the garden, and the water of the fountain
became a living flame. Helen&rsquo;s first exclamation of delight
was interrupted by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span>&rsquo;s groan of terror as
the old gardener hastily retreated to the house, crossing
himself and praying for divine protection against the
magic of the evil one which had entered and taken possession
of his very domain. The suspicion with which
he had viewed the labors of the electricians during the
past few days was now fully justified, and he saw his
work of thirty years in danger of destruction by the conflagration
which he believed must inevitably follow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid, Phil!&rdquo; cried Helen, when <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> was at
last quieted. &ldquo;I had no idea you were carrying out so
grand a scheme. What should I have done without you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Mr. Cartwright&rsquo;s idea, you know, Helen,&rdquo; insisted
Emory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To get the light up here&mdash;not the arrangement,
which is all to your credit,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody hastened to
add.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owe everything to both of you,&rdquo; said Helen, holding
out a hand to each. &ldquo;Now I want to see every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>light.&rdquo; Slowly they walked about the garden inspecting
the illumination. &ldquo;It is perfect,&rdquo; exclaimed Helen.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how pleased I am with it. I ought to
be jealous that you have so outdone me in your part of
the decoration, but I am really proud of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they were taking an admiring view of the floral
arrangements Jack and Inez rode up. Emory started
to suggest to them a view of the garden, but a glance
from Helen prevented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save it for a surprise, Phil,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;They
have no idea of what you have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock when the first guests arrived,
and for an hour Helen, Jack, and Uncle Peabody
greeted the brilliant gathering as it assembled. To most
of them Armstrong was a complete stranger, and it was
quite evident that many of those who had known and
admired Helen and Mr. Cartwright possessed no little
curiosity concerning this man of whom so little had been
seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there really is a Mr. Armstrong, after all,&rdquo;
exclaimed the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Marchesa Castellani</span>, smiling blandly as
Helen presented him. &ldquo;We had almost come to look
upon you as one of those American&mdash;what shall we say?&mdash;conceits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The color came to Helen&rsquo;s face, but before she could
reply <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> pressed forward from behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Signor</span> Armstrong has been my guest these weeks,
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">marchesa</span>, inhaling the wisdom of the past instead of the
sweeter but more transitory grandeur of Florentine society.
This has perhaps been his loss, and yours; but,
with his great work nearly ready for the press, dare
we say that the world will not be the richer for the
sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not be the one to dare,&rdquo; replied the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">marchesa</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
again smiling and passing on to make room for others
behind her.</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> watched his opportunity for another word with
Helen. &ldquo;I came to-night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;expressly to tell
you that your reward is near at hand. Another week
and your husband&rsquo;s labors will be completed. I have
thought often of our conversation, and of your patience;
but the result of my advice has been more far-reaching
even than I thought. The character-building
has extended beyond him and his &lsquo;sister-worker&rsquo;&mdash;it has
reached you as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The arrival of new guests fortunately delayed the
necessity of immediate reply, but it also gave <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> an
opportunity to watch the effect of his words. The old
man&rsquo;s voice softened as he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have suffered, my daughter; I did not know
till now how much. Yet suffering is essential. George
Eliot was a woman, and she knew a woman&rsquo;s heart when
she wrote, &lsquo;Deep, unspeakable suffering is a baptism, a
regeneration&mdash;the initiation into a new state.&rsquo; Your
initiation is passed, my daughter, and your enjoyment
of the new state is near at hand. Do you not see now
how far-reaching has been the influence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Helen replied, with a tremor in her voice;
&ldquo;and this time I think I may say that it has been more
far-reaching than even you realize.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s eyes sought hers searchingly. He had already
seen more than she had intended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the book is really coming to its completion?&rdquo;
she continued, calmly. &ldquo;And you feel well satisfied with
my husband&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is superb; it is magnificent,&rdquo; cried <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;He has produced a work which is without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
an equal in the veracity of its portrayal of the
period and in the insight which he has shown in dealing
with the characters themselves. It will make your husband
famous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be very proud of him, shall we not?&rdquo; replied
Helen, forcing a smile. &ldquo;And he will owe so much
to you for the help and the inspiration you have given
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And also to you, my daughter,&rdquo; added the librarian,
meaningly.</p>

<p>Emory approached as <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> left her side. &ldquo;Every
one is in the garden now, Helen. May I take you
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen glanced around for her husband, and saw him
somewhat apart from the other guests engaged in a conversation
with the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contessa Morelli</span>. Unconsciously her
mind went back to what the contessa had said to her
about marriage in general and about her husband in
particular, and she wondered what her new friend
thought of him, now that they had actually met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack has his hands full for the present,&rdquo; Emory remarked,
noting her glance. &ldquo;You need not worry about
him. By Jove, Helen, you are simply stunning to-night!&rdquo;
he continued, in a low voice, as they strolled
across the veranda. &ldquo;I have been anxious about you,
but now you are yourself again. You should always
wear white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen made no answer. She was recalling to herself
the fact that to-night, for the first time, Jack had made
no comment upon her appearance, as he had always done
before; yet she had tried to wear the very things which
he preferred. After all, she thought, it was better so.
But what a mockery to stand beside a man, as she stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
with Jack this evening, jointly receiving their friends
and their friends&rsquo; congratulations! What deception!
What ignominy!</p>

<p>In the mean time, as Emory had surmised, Armstrong
had his hands sufficiently full with the contessa. Her
mind had been too constantly applied to her interesting
problem, during the days which had elapsed since her
call upon <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, to allow this opportunity to escape her.
She had exercised every art she possessed to learn something
further from Helen; she even had Emory take
tea with her with the same definite object in view; but
either consciously or unconsciously both had parried her
diplomatic questioning with an air so natural and simple
as to convince her that they were not unskilled themselves
in the game in which she considered herself an
adept. The one thing which remained was the picture
she had seen at the library; but this had been so positive
in the impression which it had made that she found herself
even more keen than ever to follow up the small advantage
she had gained.</p>

<p>Watching her opportunity, Amlie found herself beside
Armstrong, with the other guests far enough removed
to enable her to converse with him without being
overheard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All Florence owes you a debt of gratitude for bringing
your beautiful wife here,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;And how
generous you have been to let us have so much of her
while you have been otherwise engaged!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been my misfortune not to be able to share
her social pleasures,&rdquo; Armstrong replied. &ldquo;Perhaps she
has told you of the serious work upon which I am engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; answered the contessa, cheerfully. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
am sure every man in Florence who has had an opportunity
to meet your wife has blessed you for your devotion
to this &lsquo;serious work,&rsquo; as you call it. Italian husbands
are not so generous, especially upon their honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong bowed stiffly. The contessa&rsquo;s manner was
far too affable to warrant him in taking offence, yet
he felt distinctly annoyed by what she said. Amlie,
however, gave him no opportunity to reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know these Italian husbands,&rdquo; she continued,
shrugging her beautiful shoulders. &ldquo;I have one,
so I know all about it. They go into paroxysms of fury
even at the thought of having their wives go about
without them, receiving the admiration of other men. I
have no doubt that at this very moment my dear <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Morelli</span>
is either abusing one of the servants or breaking some of
the furniture, just because I happen to be here while he
is nursing his gouty foot at home. I am always proud
of my countrymen when I see them, as you are, willing
to let their wives enjoy themselves without them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think I have observed this trait among
American husbands developed to the extent you mention,&rdquo;
Armstrong observed, with little enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; queried the contessa, innocently.
&ldquo;Perhaps that is because you are such a learned man,
with your eyes upon your books instead of upon the
world. You must take my word that it is so. But you
know enough of the world to recognize admiration when
you yourself become the object of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amlie fastened upon her companion an arch smile
so full of meaning that Armstrong was caught entirely
off his guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I the object of admiration?&rdquo; he asked, incredulously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
&ldquo;I wish I might think that you were speaking of
your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contessa laughed merrily. &ldquo;I certainly laid myself
open for that, did I not?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Now suppose
I had said adoration instead of admiration, then
you would not have replied as you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hardly have so presumed,&rdquo; he said, mystified
by the contessa&rsquo;s conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet I have seen you the object of adoration&mdash;nothing
less. I have seen eyes resting upon your face filled
with a devotion which a woman never gives but once.
You ought to feel very proud to be able to inspire all
that, Mr. Armstrong. I should if I were a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have evidently mistaken me for some one else,
contessa. Otherwise I cannot understand what you are
saying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amlie looked at him curiously. &ldquo;I wonder if you are
really ignorant of all this?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say that you have witnessed it, so it cannot
be my wife of whom you speak, as you have never
seen us together. I certainly know of no other woman
who cares two straws about me. It must be that you
have taken some one else for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I am not mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s curiosity proved stronger than his resentment.
&ldquo;And you have actually seen this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where and when?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contessa&rsquo;s mood had become serious. She realized
that she was playing with dangerous weapons. &ldquo;If you
are sincere in what you say, Mr. Armstrong, you would
not thank me for telling you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have gone so far that now I must insist.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Helen&rsquo;s words suddenly came back to him as he spoke.
The contessa saw a change of expression come over his
face, and she held back her answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it at the Laurentian Library?&rdquo; Armstrong
asked, impulsively.</p>

<p>Amlie smiled triumphantly. &ldquo;It is really better for
me not to answer that question, my dear Mr. Armstrong.
I only meant to pay you a compliment, and I fear
that I have touched on something I should have avoided.
You will forgive me, will you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong was for the moment too occupied with his
own thoughts to comprehend fully what she said to him.
Mechanically he pressed the hand which was held out to
him, and a moment later the contessa entered into a
merry conversation with some of her friends in the garden.
Too late he realized that he had tacitly accepted
the compromising position into which she had led him.</p>

<p>Emory left Helen in the midst of an animated group
discussing in enthusiastic tones their appreciation of
the many innovations. The musicians were concealed
in the &ldquo;snuggery,&rdquo; playing airs from favorite operas,
while waiters from Doney&rsquo;s served <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">gelati</i> and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">paste</i> and
champagne at little tables scattered throughout the garden.
The cool air was grateful to Helen, and she threw
herself into the enjoyment of the moment. No one
among her guests realized how little the brilliant, happy
scene fitted in with the sorrow in her heart. Yet the
musicians played on, the guests chatted merrily, and the
lights reflected only that side of life which Helen felt
was hers no more. The hour-glass filled and emptied,
with no change save the departure of the guests.</p>

<p>As the last good-night was spoken Helen sought mechanically
the low retaining wall against which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
so often rested. Jack and Uncle Peabody were for the
moment inside the house, and she was alone. Yes, alone!
How strongly she felt it, now that the stillness replaced
the hum of voices which had filled the garden! Her
features did not change, but a tear, unchecked as it was
unbidden, coursed its way down her cheeks. Emory saw
it as he approached, unnoticed, to say good-night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; he whispered, softly.</p>

<p>She turned quickly and brushed the tear away with
her hand. &ldquo;How you startled me!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
thought every one had gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; Emory repeated, &ldquo;you are unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tired,&rdquo; she replied, lightly; &ldquo;that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that is not all,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;You are miserably
unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Phil,&rdquo; she entreated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must, Helen,&rdquo; Emory kept on. &ldquo;I should have
no respect for myself if I kept silent another moment.
All this time I have stood by and seen you suffer without
saying a word, when I have longed to take you in my
arms in spite of all and comfort you as you needed to be
comforted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phil, I beg of you!&rdquo; Helen cried, beseechingly.
&ldquo;You must not say such things. I am not strong
enough to stop you, and every word adds to the pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is pain!&rdquo; cried Emory, fiercely. &ldquo;At last
I know it from your own lips. And if there is pain it
gives me the right to protect you from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Phil!&rdquo; Helen sank helplessly into a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the right,&rdquo; Emory repeated. &ldquo;My love,
which you cast aside when you accepted him, now gives
it to me; my loyalty in surrendering you to him for
what I thought was your happiness now gives it to me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
his selfishness and his neglect now give it to me. And I
claim my right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made no reply. Convulsed with weeping, she sat
huddled in the chair, helpless in her sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to Jack Armstrong now,&rdquo; continued
Emory, savagely. &ldquo;I am going to tell him what a brute
he is and demand you of him. I did not give you up to
be tortured by neglect while he devotes himself to his
&lsquo;affinity.&rsquo;&rdquo; Emory&rsquo;s voice grew bitter. &ldquo;And he calls
it his &lsquo;masterpiece&rsquo;! Better men than he have called it
by another name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen rose, white and ghostlike in the pale, dim light.
She was calm again, and her voice was compelling in its
quiet force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been my friend, Phil&mdash;a friend on whom
I have felt I could rely always; yet you take this one
moment, when I need real, honest friendship more than
ever before in all my life, to add another burden. Is
it kind, Phil&mdash;is it noble? I have suffered&mdash;I admit it.
Jack is the cause of it&mdash;I admit that, too. You have
discovered all this by pulling aside the veil which by
my friend should have been held sacred; but with my
heart laid bare before you, can you not see that it contains
no thought except of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not believe it,&rdquo; Emory replied, stubbornly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must believe it,&rdquo; she continued, with finality.
&ldquo;You know that my words are true. Jack Armstrong
is my husband and I am his wife. We must forget what
you have said and never refer to it again. Come, let
us join them in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we must say good-night here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory took the outstretched hand in his. For a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
their eyes met firmly. Then he raised her fingers
to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not good-night, Helen,&rdquo; he said, his voice
breaking as he spoke; &ldquo;do you understand, it is not
good-night&mdash;it is good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her glance did not falter, though a new sensation of
pain passed through her heart. &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she replied,
faintly, as she gently withdrew her hand.</p>

<p>Armstrong watched Emory&rsquo;s hasty departure and
Helen&rsquo;s slow return to the house from his unintentional
place of concealment behind the oleanders, where his
footsteps had been arrested by the sound of voices. The
contessa&rsquo;s remarks had recalled with vivid intensity his
conversation with Helen about Inez. She regarded his
relations with Miss Thayer to be at least questionable,
and he impatiently awaited the departure of the guests
to tell Helen what had happened and to set himself
right in her eyes. Now he had just heard Emory
express himself even more pointedly upon the same
subject.</p>

<p>The consciousness that he had been an eavesdropper,
even though unwittingly, prevented him from carrying
out his purpose. As he saw Helen drag herself rather
than walk along the paths, he longed to fold her to his
heart and brush away her doubts for all time; but to
do this he must disclose his uncomfortable position, and
this he could not do. His resentment against Emory
faded away in the face of Helen&rsquo;s splendid loyalty.
&ldquo;My heart contains no thought except of him,&rdquo; he had
heard her say; and he thanked God that his awakening
had not come too late.</p>

<p>After a few moments he returned to the house from
the opposite side of the garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Helen?&rdquo; he asked Uncle Peabody, whom he
met at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has gone to her room, Jack,&rdquo; Mr. Cartwright
replied, without meeting his eyes. &ldquo;She said she was
very tired, and asked particularly not to be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong hesitated. She was hardly strong enough
to talk the matter over to-night, anyway. It would be
a kindness to leave it until to-morrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God it is not too late!&rdquo; Uncle Peabody heard
him repeat to himself, and the old man wondered if,
after all, the sun was going to shine through the cypress-trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XXII</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>Helen did not come down to breakfast the next
morning, so Armstrong and Miss Thayer found
themselves at the library at their usual hour in
spite of the festivities of the night before. The events
of the evening impressed upon Jack the necessity of
bringing his work to a speedy conclusion. With feverish
haste, and forgetful of his companion, he seized his
pen and transferred to the blank paper before him the
words which came faster than they could be transcribed.
Left to her own resources, Inez picked up the bunch of
manuscript and settled back in her chair to run it over,
glancing from time to time at Armstrong, who seemed
consumed by the task before him. Accustomed as she
was to his moods while at work, Inez was almost frightened
by the present intensity. She hesitated even to
move about lest he be disturbed, yet until he gave her
something to do she was wholly unemployed.</p>

<p>For over an hour Armstrong&rsquo;s pen ran on. The fever
was upon him, the message was in his mind, the spirit
must be translated to the more tangible medium of words.
At length, utterly exhausted for the moment, he threw
aside his pen and leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; he cried, looking for the first time
into Inez&rsquo; face; &ldquo;all is now actually written, and the
revision alone remains.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Inez started to speak a word of congratulation, but
in a flood of realization she knew that the companionship
of the past three months was at an end. For the
revision Armstrong would need no assistance; so she
faltered for a moment, but the omission was unnoticed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just written the summary in the last chapter,&rdquo;
Armstrong continued. &ldquo;I have taken <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span>&rsquo;s
allegorical statues in the Laurentian Chapel
as typifying the characteristics and the tendencies of
the period. All that I have written seems naturally
to lead up to them. Listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a rich, tense voice Armstrong read from the sheets
which he gathered together in proper sequence:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span> himself has given us in his marbles
the truest interpretation of the times in which he lived.
After analyzing his correspondence and deducing from
this the customs of the people, we turn to a consideration
of the principles which lay beneath. The sculptor was
a poet, and the soul of the poet found expression not
through his words but through his hands. In the sacristy
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Lorenzo</span> there are the tombs of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Medici</span>,
designed by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Michelangelo</span>. They are unfinished, as is
typical of the period in which they were designed. At
the entrance to these tombs rest allegorical figures, which
to the casual observer indicate phases of darkness and
of light, of death and of life. They are two women and
two men, and tradition names them &lsquo;Night&rsquo; and &lsquo;Day,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Twilight&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dawning.&rsquo; To one who analyzes them,
however, after a profound study of the times in which
they were produced, comes a realization that they typify
the character and the religious belief of the people themselves.
These statues and their attendant <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">genii</span> are a
series of abstractions, symbolizing the sleep and waking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of existence, action, and thought, the gloom of death, the
lustre of life, and the intermediate states of sadness and
of hope that form the borderland of both. Life is a
dream between two slumbers; sleep is death&rsquo;s twin-brother;
night is the shadow of death, and death is
the gate of life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In each of these statues there is a palpitating
thought, torn from the artist&rsquo;s soul and crystallized
in marble. It has been said that architecture is petrified
music; each of these statues becomes for us a passion, fit
for musical expression, but turned, like Niobe, to stone.
They have the intellectual vagueness, the emotional certainty
that belong to the motives of a symphony. In
their allegories, left without a key, sculpture has passed
beyond her old domain of placid concrete form. The
anguish of intolerable emotion, the quickening of the
consciousness to a sense of suffering, the acceptance of
the inevitable, the strife of the soul with destiny, the
burden and the passion of mankind&mdash;this is the symbolism
of the period as expressed by their cold, chisel-tortured
marble.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid, my son!&rdquo; spoke <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s proud voice as
the librarian advanced toward them out of the dim recess
in which he had been standing; &ldquo;that is a fitting
ending to a magnificent work. Your use of the statues
as symbolisms of their period is masterly. I myself have
felt it often, but with me the feeling has never found
expression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a period that was!&rdquo; exclaimed Armstrong.
&ldquo;How it seizes one, even now, after four hundred years!
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Padre</span>,&rdquo; he said to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;you
say that this work of mine is good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The librarian nodded assent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If that is so,&rdquo; continued Armstrong, impressively,
&ldquo;it is no more to my credit than if <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Machiavelli</span>
or <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Leonardo</span> or the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Buonarroti</span> himself had written
it. It is they who have held my hand and guided my
pen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my son,&rdquo; cried <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, with delight, &ldquo;you are
indeed a true humanist&mdash;a man in whom the ancients
take delight! Too bad that you must drop it all, after
your brief experience among this galaxy of greatness,
to return to the humdrum of commonplace existence&mdash;too
bad, too bad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never give it up, padre,&rdquo; Armstrong replied,
firmly; &ldquo;I could not if I tried.&rdquo; He paused as he recalled
Helen&rsquo;s wan face and spiritless step. &ldquo;I have
been too intense. I owe it to my wife to share with her
interests which lie along other lines, but my life-work
has already been plotted out for me. I met these gods
years ago, and I did not know them; I felt them calling
me back to them, and I obeyed. They have let me sip
their cup of wisdom, and he who once tastes that delectable
draught runs the risk of becoming no longer his
own master. I must leave them for a breathing-spell;
I can never wholly give myself to them again; but never
fear, I shall ever come back to them. I could not help
it if I tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The librarian watched the enthusiasm of the younger
man with rapture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, my son!&rdquo; he cried, joyfully; &ldquo;my life has
not been spent in vain if I have succeeded in joining one
such modern intellect to that noble band of sages who,
though of the past, are ever in the present. And you,
too, my daughter,&rdquo; he continued, turning to Inez&mdash;&ldquo;you,
too, have sipped the draught our friend speaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of; you, too, are linked irrevocably to the wisdom of the
ages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez bowed her head as if receiving a benediction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have tasted of it, father,&rdquo; she replied, seriously,
&ldquo;but only in degree. This experience is one which can
never be forgotten, can never be repeated. I feel as if
I were saying good-bye to friends dear and true whom
I shall never see again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why should you
ever say good-bye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez tried to smile, but her attempt ended in a pitiful
failure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing very strange about it,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;You and I drifted into this work together
almost by accident. To me it has been a happy accident,
and I like to think that I have helped a little in your
splendid achievement. It has been an experience of a
lifetime, but, like most experiences which are worth anything,
it could never happen again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong failed utterly to grasp the significance of
her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, unless you wished it so,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even though I wished it,&rdquo; replied Inez, firmly.</p>

<p>The contessa&rsquo;s words were in Armstrong&rsquo;s mind as
he looked into her face. If Helen could hear what she
had just said his explanations would be unnecessary.
He wished the contessa were there, if she really possessed
any such idea as her conversation had suggested. This
girl in love with him, yet calmly stating that their association
was at an end, and that any continuance was an
impossibility!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been a strain, Miss Thayer, as Helen said,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
he replied, finally; &ldquo;I feel it myself. With the manuscript
actually completed, I shall take my time in putting
it into final shape. And now I suggest that we
get out into the air. Suppose we take a little run in
the motor-car out around <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Domenico</span>, and then back
home, to surprise them at luncheon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez saw in Armstrong&rsquo;s suggestion a relaxing of the
strained condition which she had brought upon herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Monsignor <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> will join us,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; replied the librarian, with sudden fervor.
&ldquo;I may indulge myself in air-ships when once they
become popular, but never in an automobile! I will
have <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maritelli</span> telephone for your car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez smiled at Jack as they watched <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> disappear
through the door of his study. Then Armstrong&rsquo;s
face grew serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old man loves me as if I were his son,&rdquo; he said,
feelingly. &ldquo;He is more proud of what I have done than
if he had accomplished it himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has reason to be proud,&rdquo; replied Inez; &ldquo;and so
have we all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="r3">In olden days the bishop who was obliged to visit
his diocese at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Domenico</span> or at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span> had not spoken
so lightly of the trip. Setting out on mule-back, and
scattering blessings as he left the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Porta a Pinti</span> by the
road still called the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Via Fiesolana</span>, he hoped to reach
the &ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Riposo dei Vescovi</span>&rdquo; in time for dinner. There,
after a bountiful repast, he discarded his faithful beast
of burden, and entered the ox-drawn sledge which the
monks of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Domenico</span> were bound to provide, reaching
the hill-top, if all went well, about sunset. But
this was before the days even of the stage-coaches, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
before the modern tramway enabled Mother Florence
to reach out and enfold her daughters in her arms.</p>

<p>The chauffeur carefully picked his way through the
narrow <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Borgo San Lorenzo</span> into the more spacious
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza del Duomo</span>. Passing around the apse of the
cathedral, they entered the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Via de&rsquo; Servi</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometime we must stop and take a look at these
fine old palaces,&rdquo; said Armstrong, leaning forward and
pointing down the street. &ldquo;The Antinori, for instance,
has just been restored, and it has one of the most stunning
Renaissance court-yards in all Florence. We shall
pass by it in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The car crossed the square of the SS. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annunziata</span>,
where they stopped for a moment again to admire
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andrea Della Robbia</span>&rsquo;s swaddled babies on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faade</span>
of the Foundling Hospital, and to look up from <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tacca</span>&rsquo;s
statue of Duke Ferdinand to the window of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Antinori</span>
Palace, hoping for a glimpse of that face from the past,
whose history is recorded by Browning in his &ldquo;Statue
and the Bust.&rdquo; From this point the road was clearer,
passing up the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Via Gino Capponi</span>, where Armstrong
again pointed out the house of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andrea del Sarto</span>&mdash;&ldquo;the
little house he used to be so gay in&rdquo;&mdash;past the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Capponi</span> Palace, and also that of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Clemente</span>, where
lived and died the last Stuart Pretender. With increasing
speed, they crossed the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Viale Principe Amedeo</span>, past
the gloomy <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza Savonarola</span>, around the Cemetery of
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Misericordia</span>, to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Gervasio</span>, where the real ascent
began.</p>

<p>The sudden change from the close atmosphere of the
library to the invigorating air acted as a tonic on Armstrong
and his companion; and in addition to this the
tension of three months&rsquo; close application was lightened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
The book was actually written! Inez thought she had
never seen him in so incomparable a mood, as he called her
attention to many little points of interest which, during
other rides, had been passed unnoticed. On they went,
olive gardens alternating with splendid villas on either
side, until, almost before they realized it, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Domenico</span>
was reached, and they paused to regard the magnificent
panorama spread out before their eyes. Armstrong
looked back and saw the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Via della Piazzola</span> behind him.
Then his glance turned to the steep hill in front. In a
flood of memory came back to him the details of the
last time he had been there&mdash;alone with Helen, so soon
after their arrival in Florence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I measure everything by that day at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span>,&rdquo; she
had said to him; &ldquo;I believe it was the happiest day I
ever spent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How long ago it seemed to him, and how much had
happened since! She was not happy now&mdash;she had told
him so with her own lips; she had even been forced to
acknowledge it to Emory. He had been forgetful of
her during these weeks of study; but it was over now,
and he would make it up to her. When she saw him
back in his old semblance again her pain would pass
away, her happiness return, and the present misunderstanding
be forgotten.</p>

<p>His thoughts of Helen reminded him of his intention
to return to the villa in time for luncheon, after which
he would tell her how deeply he regretted all that had
happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn around, Alfonse,&rdquo; he said, looking at his
watch, &ldquo;and run home as fast as you can; we have
hardly time to get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The return toward Florence was quickly made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
spite of the sudden bends and narrow roads. Turning
sharply at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ponte a Mensola</span>, Alfonse increased his speed
as they approached the hill leading from the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza</span> of
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Settignano</span> to the villa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Careful at the next turn, Alfonse; it&rsquo;s a nasty
one,&rdquo; cautioned Armstrong, aware that his instructions
were being carried out too literally.</p>

<p>The machine was nearer to the corner than Alfonse
realized. He saw the danger, and with his hand upon
the emergency-brake he threw his weight upon the wheel.
Something gave way, and in another moment the car
crashed against the masonry wall, the engine made a
few convulsive revolutions, and then lay inert and helpless.</p>

<p>Inez was thrown over the low wall, landing without injury
in the cornfield on the other side. Alfonse jumped,
and found himself torn and bruised upon the road, with
no injuries which could not easily be mended. But Armstrong,
sitting nearest to the point of contact, lay amid
the wreckage of the machine, still and lifeless, with a
gash in the side of his head, showing where he had
struck the wall.</p>

<p>By the time Inez had found an opening Alfonse had
gathered himself up, and together they lifted Armstrong
on to the grass by the side of the road. Two
frightened women and a boy hurried out from the peasant&rsquo;s
cottage near by, the women wringing their hands,
the boy stupefied by fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some water, quick!&rdquo; commanded Inez; and one of
the women hastened to obey.</p>

<p>Wetting her handkerchief and kneeling beside the still
figure, Inez bathed Armstrong&rsquo;s face and washed the
blood from the ugly cut. She chafed his hands and felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
his pulse. There was no response, and she turned her
ashen face to the women watching breathless beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; she said, in an almost inarticulate voice.
The women crossed themselves and burst into tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May we take him in there,&rdquo; she asked, pointing to
the cottage, &ldquo;while the chauffeur brings his wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Between them the body was gently lifted into the cottage
and laid upon the bed in the best room. Then
Alfonse set out upon his solemn mission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me with him,&rdquo; Inez begged rather than commanded
the woman who remained. &ldquo;I will stay with
him until they come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She closed the door. Leaning against it for support,
with her hand upon the latch, she gazed at the inanimate
form upon the bed. The necessity of action had
dulled her realization of the horror, and, sinking upon
the floor, she buried her face in her hands, giving way
for the first time to the tears which until now had been
denied. The first paroxysm over, she raised her head
and looked about the room. Every object in it burned
itself into her mind: the straw matting on the floor, the
cheap prints upon the wall, the rough cross and the
crucified Saviour hanging over the bed. Dead&mdash;dead!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, God,&rdquo; she murmured, incoherently, to herself,
&ldquo;is this to be the solution of this awful problem&mdash;inexplicable
in life, unendurable in death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose from the floor and stood erect. She
looked at the closed door&mdash;then turned to where the
body lay. She rested her hand upon Armstrong&rsquo;s forehead.
Then sitting upon the edge of the bed she gently
lifted his arm and grasped his hand as her body became
convulsed with heart-breaking sobs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she cried, covering his hands with kisses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
&ldquo;Jack&mdash;speak to me! Tell me that you are not dead,&rdquo;
she implored. &ldquo;Oh no, no&mdash;that cannot be; you are too
grand, too noble to die like this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose and stood for a moment looking down at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; she repeated, piteously&mdash;&ldquo;dead!&rdquo; A hectic
glow came into her face. &ldquo;Then you are mine!&rdquo; she
cried, fiercely. &ldquo;Jack, my beloved, you are mine, dear&mdash;do
you hear?&mdash;and I am yours. Oh, Jack, how I have
loved you all these weeks! Now I can tell you of it,
dear&mdash;it will do no harm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again she sat upon the bed and placed her hands
upon his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling, my beloved!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Open
your eyes just once and tell me that I may call you
mine if only for this one terrible moment. This is our
moment, dear&mdash;no one can take it from us! Have you
not seen how I have loved you, how I have struggled
to keep you from knowing it. Jack, Jack! this is the
beginning and the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room seemed to spin around, and before her eyes
a mist gathered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am dying, too, Jack,&rdquo; she said, frankly&mdash;&ldquo;thank
God, I am dying, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last Nature applied her saving balm to the strained
nerves, and Inez&rsquo; sufferings were temporarily assuaged
by that sweet insensibility which stands between the
human mind and madness. So Helen found her, a few
moments later, when pale and trembling she entered the
room.</p>

<hr class="l2"/>


<p>Helen received the heart-breaking news from
Alfonse with a degree of control which surprised
even Uncle Peabody. Her questions were few,
but so vital in their directness that by the time she had
learned the nature and the seriousness of the accident,
and the location of the cottage where her husband&rsquo;s
body lay, she was hurrying to the scene of the calamity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know where to reach an American or English
surgeon?&rdquo; she promptly asked Uncle Peabody, and
his affirmative reply as he hastened to the telephone was
the last word she heard as she left the villa.</p>

<p>Once in the cottage, she followed the guidance of the
weeping, awe-struck peasants, who silently pointed out
to her the room of death. She opened the door, and
crossed the room with a firm step. Sinking to her knees
beside the bed, she buried her face for a brief moment in
her hands&mdash;then she rose quickly to her feet. With
the help of the woman who had entered with her, she
lifted Inez&rsquo; inert figure from across her husband&rsquo;s body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has fainted, poor child!&rdquo; she said, quietly,
divining that the girl&rsquo;s insensibility was not serious.
&ldquo;Let us take her into the next room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving the woman to provide for Inez&rsquo; necessities,
and giving her instructions how to act, Helen turned
from the improvised cot to go back to Jack. His hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
were still warm, but she could find no perceptible pulsation.
She loosened his collar and moved his head a little
to one side, discovering the wound for the first time.
A cry of pain burst from her as she drew back sick and
dizzy, her lips quivering and tears starting to her eyes.
Then she leaned over him again, gently washing away
the slight flow of blood with a moist cloth which one
of the women handed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried, pathetically, to Uncle Peabody,
who entered the room a moment later, pointing to the
wound and gazing into his eyes with her own distended
by her suffering and her sense of helplessness.</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody put his arm about her, and rested his
other hand upon Armstrong&rsquo;s wrist. &ldquo;Dr. Montgomery
will be here in a moment, Helen,&rdquo; he said, quietly, feeling
instinctively that this was no time for words of sympathy.
&ldquo;I caught him at the Grand Hotel, and there
was a motor-car at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is dead!&rdquo; was Helen&rsquo;s response, piteous in its
intensity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, dear,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody, soothingly.
&ldquo;Let us stand by the window until the doctor
comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen refused to suffer herself to be led away from
her husband&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, simply, shaking her head; &ldquo;I
must watch over him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she turned back to resume her self-appointed
vigil, and suddenly found herself looking into his open
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she cried, seizing his face in her hands as she
again sank upon her knees&mdash;&ldquo;oh, Jack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could find no other words in the revulsion which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
swept over her. Her cry quickly brought Uncle Peabody,
and the women drew near to behold the miracle
of the dead brought to life; but all except Helen fell
back as the doctor entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He lives, doctor!&rdquo; she exclaimed exultantly, her face
radiant with joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is hope,&rdquo; he replied, with a reassuring
smile, as he began the examination of his patient.</p>

<p>Helen followed every motion as the doctor proceeded,
encouraged by the confidential little nods he made at
the conclusion of each process, as if answering in the
affirmative certain questions which he put to himself.
Armstrong again opened his eyes as the doctor carefully
investigated the depth of the wound, and his lips moved
slightly. Helen impulsively drew nearer, but the sound
was barely articulate.</p>

<p>The doctor drew back the lids and peered intently
into his open eyes, nodding again to himself. At length
he turned to the silent group about him, who so eagerly
waited for the verdict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he live?&rdquo; was Helen&rsquo;s tense question as she
seized his arm.</p>

<p>Dr. Montgomery looked into the upturned face with
a kindly smile. &ldquo;I hope so, Mrs. Armstrong,&rdquo; he answered,
quietly. &ldquo;It is a severe concussion of the brain,
and we must await developments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there unfavorable signs?&rdquo; asked Uncle Peabody,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; quite the contrary so far. There is no fracture
of the skull, and the normal size of the pupils shows no
serious injury to the brain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The unconsciousness is due simply to the concussion?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what do you fear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is always danger of meningitis. We can tell
nothing about this until later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it be safe to move him?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and you had better do so. I must dress and
sew up the wound, and then he can be carried home on
a stretcher. Suppose you leave me alone with him now,
while I make his head a bit more presentable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s buoyancy was contagious as she and Uncle
Peabody started to leave the room, but Jack&rsquo;s voice recalled
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;the symbolism&mdash;of the period,&rdquo; he muttered,
incoherently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; the doctor replied to Helen&rsquo;s startled,
unspoken interrogation. &ldquo;He is delirious, and will be
so for days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Satisfied with the explanation, they passed through
the door into the next room, where they found Inez
sitting weakly in an arm-chair, her hair dishevelled, her
face white as marble, supported by the woman in whose
care she had been left.</p>

<p>Helen hurried to her. &ldquo;He is not dead!&rdquo; she cried,
joyfully&mdash;&ldquo;do you hear, Inez? Jack is alive, and the
doctor thinks he will recover!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez answered with a fresh flood of tears. &ldquo;Oh,
Helen! Helen!&rdquo; she murmured, clinging impulsively to
her arm.</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s recovery came much more spontaneously than
did Inez&rsquo;. With the one the pendulum had made a
completed swing, and the depths at one extreme had
been offset by the heights at the other. Inez, however,
was hopelessly distraught by the accumulated weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of a multitude of emotions: the physical shock of the
accident, the horror of the situation as it first burst upon
her with unmitigated force, the involuntary tearing
from her heart of the mask it had worn for so many
months&mdash;and now the painful joy of the reaction. She
rested in her chair, almost an inert mass, in total collapse
of mind and body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not help it, Helen,&rdquo; she murmured, piteously,
as her friend pushed back the dishevelled hair from
her hot forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you could not, dear,&rdquo; Helen cried, smiling
through her tears of joy at the obvious relief her words
gave. &ldquo;Oh, I am so happy, Inez!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s face grew pale again as her thoughts returned
to those first awful moments, which now seemed so long
ago. &ldquo;I really thought him dead, Inez,&rdquo; she continued,
after a moment&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;We could not have endured
that, could we, dear? Now we will take him to the
villa and nurse him back to health and strength. How
strange it will seem to him not to be able to do things
for himself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;badly hurt?&rdquo; ventured Inez.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor can&rsquo;t tell yet, but he feels encouraged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;conscious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not wholly&mdash;and the doctor says he will be delirious
for days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Inez, again relaxing.</p>

<p>Dr. Montgomery quietly entered the room, carefully
closing the door after him. &ldquo;All goes well,&rdquo; he replied
to the questions before they were put to him. &ldquo;The
patient is resting quietly and may be moved as soon as
a stretcher can be secured. Your villa is near by, I
think Mr. Cartwright said?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The stretcher is being prepared,&rdquo; replied Uncle
Peabody, answering the doctor&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;and I have
sent for two strong men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Have I another patient here?&rdquo; Dr. Montgomery
turned to Inez.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is suffering only from the shock,&rdquo; answered
Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me take you both home in my motor-car,&rdquo; suggested
the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take Miss Thayer,&rdquo; Helen replied, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; Inez shuddered; &ldquo;I can never enter one
of those awful things again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Montgomery smiled indulgently. &ldquo;It will really
be better, Miss Thayer, and I will personally guarantee
your safe arrival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather walk beside the stretcher,&rdquo; Helen
continued; &ldquo;there might be something I could do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor bowed as he acquiesced. &ldquo;Your husband
will require very little to be done for him for some days,
Mrs. Armstrong,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but if you prefer to stay
near him your suggestion is better than mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he speak again, doctor?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, with a professional shrug; &ldquo;but
he said nothing. You must pay no attention to his
ramblings. His mind will remain a blank until Nature
supplies the connecting link. In the mean time he will
require simply quiet and rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s stretcher was soon ready for service,
and the still unconscious burden was gently lifted upon
it and carried with utmost tenderness up the hill to the
villa, where old <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuseppe</span> and the maids received the
party with unaffected joy at the good news that their
master would survive the accident that had befallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
him. With the aid of the trained nurse they found
awaiting them, Armstrong was carefully transferred
from the stretcher to his own bed, Inez was made comfortable
in her room, and the doctor sat down upon the
veranda with Helen and Uncle Peabody, who welcomed
a moment&rsquo;s rest after the wearing experience of the
past hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us the probabilities of the case, Dr. Montgomery,&rdquo;
said Uncle Peabody. &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong
were planning to return to Boston soon, and
now it will of course be necessary to rearrange their
plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; assented the doctor. &ldquo;I will tell you
all I can. These cases are somewhat uncertain, but
the patient&rsquo;s delirium will surely last for several days.
Then comes a slow period of convalescence, during which
time the body repairs much more rapidly than the mind.
You cannot count on less than two months, even with
everything progressing favorably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody glanced over to where Helen was
sitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how long it takes,&rdquo; she replied to his
implied interrogation, &ldquo;so long as he gets well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Montgomery smiled as he rose to take his leave.
&ldquo;My patient is evidently in good hands,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The nurse will do all that needs to be done until I
return in the course of an hour or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen and Uncle Peabody sat in silence for some moments
after the doctor departed. There was nothing
further to be done for the present, as both Jack and
Inez were resting as comfortably as could be expected
under the circumstances, and absolute quiet was the
one thing needful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Uncle Peabody, at length, &ldquo;it is the unexpected
which has happened again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Helen assented without looking up; &ldquo;if it
keeps on happening with such startling regularity I
shall begin to expect it, and then your theory will lose
its point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody was in a thoughtful rather than an
argumentative mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I was not afraid you would think me heartless,
Helen, I would say that I believe I see the hand of
Providence in this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, assuming that Jack recovers,&rdquo; he hastened
to add.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid my philosophy is hardly equal to this
test,&rdquo; Helen replied, unsympathetically. &ldquo;I am supremely
happy that the affair is not so serious as it
seemed at first, but I can&rsquo;t see anything particularly
providential in the injury poor Jack has sustained, nor
in the suffering he must pass through at best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not just possible that this long period of convalescence,
which Dr. Montgomery says is inevitable,
may bring him to himself again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen smiled sadly. &ldquo;It was the work at the library
which brought him to himself, uncle. A separation from
those influences which so strongly affected him there
may result in a return to the old self I knew before we
came here; but that is not his real self.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he returns to that condition, no matter what
brings it about, will it not simplify matters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how,&rdquo; replied Helen, seriously. &ldquo;If I
had never known this new development in Jack&rsquo;s nature,
I should of course be quite content to have him return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
to his former self; but having seen him as he really is,
I could never accept any condition which allows him no
development of his higher and stronger personality. It
would not be fair either to him or to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody regarded Helen curiously. &ldquo;Let me
make myself clearer,&rdquo; he said, with considerable emphasis.
&ldquo;Only this very morning you were discussing
with me the final outcome of what appeared to be a
domestic tragedy. Your husband was controlled by the
spell of the old-time learning which had reached out
from its antiquity to grasp a modern convert. You
were convinced that Miss Thayer&rsquo;s sentiments toward
your husband had developed into affection, and you
stated in so many words that if Jack did not reciprocate
this affection he really ought to do so, because she was
the one woman in the world qualified by nature to be his
wife. In the presence of this overwhelming condition
you very generously planned&mdash;and I expressed to you
how much I admired your spirit&mdash;to eliminate yourself,
and to sacrifice your own happiness in order to enable
your husband to accomplish his destiny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are making sport of me&mdash;it is most unkind!&rdquo;
she cried, reproachfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; insisted Uncle Peabody.
&ldquo;I am merely presenting a simple statement of
the case in order to prove my original assertion. Please
let me continue. Just as the crisis seems to be at hand
this accident occurs. In a most unexpected manner
Jack is instantly divorced from the influences which
have drawn him away from you. The break between
him and Miss Thayer has been accomplished naturally,
and he has been placed in his wife&rsquo;s hands to be nursed
back to health&mdash;during which experience you both will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
come to know each other far better than ever before.
Again I say&mdash;I believe I see the hand of Providence in
the whole affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen waited to make quite sure that Uncle Peabody
had finished. &ldquo;I wonder if it is I who always see things
differently,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or if a man&rsquo;s viewpoint is of
necessity different from a woman&rsquo;s. I love Jack more
than I can ever express&mdash;and this accident has brought
that devotion nearer to the surface than I have dared to
let it come for many weeks. I have suffered in seeing
him drawn away from me, and in realizing that I was
becoming less and less essential to his life. Yet, through
it all, I have understood. I have suffered to think
that any other woman could be more to him than I am,
but my love has not blinded my eyes to what I have
actually seen. These are conditions which cannot be
changed, even by this accident. Suppose it does separate
him from all those influences which have brought
about the crisis, as you call it; suppose that because of
this separation, and the physical weakness through which
he must pass, Jack turns to me as before, and for the
time being believes that I am more to him than all else
in the world&mdash;will this change the conditions themselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you would not accept this change
in him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that I would not take advantage of it,&rdquo;
replied Helen, firmly. &ldquo;I have seen the development
which has taken place in Jack from the moment of our
first meeting down to the present time. Even with the
sorrow it has cost me I admire that development. Had
I possessed equal possibilities, all would have been well.
As I did not, it would be the act not of love but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
tyranny to stand between him and his grander
potentiality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose that as Jack recovers he comes to a
realization that his obsession has been a mistake&mdash;that
your love and companionship really mean more to him
than anything he can get elsewhere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be a retrogression, after what I have
seen him pass through. As I just said, if I possessed
the ability to rise to him, what you suggest might be
a possibility; but I would never consent to have him
assume a lower plane than that upon which he belongs
simply that I may retain my claim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen rose as she spoke and walked slowly down the
veranda. Uncle Peabody watched her retreating figure,
and studied her face as she returned and leaned against
one of the pillars in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you think it would force him to take a lower
plane?&rdquo; he asked, pointedly.</p>

<p>Helen turned abruptly and looked at him with an expression
of frank surprise. &ldquo;Why do I think so?&rdquo; she
repeated. &ldquo;What a foolish question!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, I ask you for an answer,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he is so far ahead of me in every way,&rdquo;
Helen answered, simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose this is not true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so positive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is quite apparent to every one&mdash;to Jack,
to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, and even to myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody rose and stood beside her, taking her
face between his hands and looking kindly into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not so far behind him as you think,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
said, firmly. &ldquo;Whatever the distance between you may
have been when you were first married, the trials I have
seen you endure have wrought changes at least as great
as those you have noticed in Jack. You are a brave,
strong woman, Helen, and your development has been
from within outward. I wish I could say as much for
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are trying to give me courage, you dear old
comforter,&rdquo; Helen replied, unconvinced but with a grateful
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am trying to show you yourself as you really are,
my child,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody replied, &ldquo;and to help you to
recognize an act of Providence when one falls your way.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XXIV</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>Dr. Montgomery&rsquo;s approximate estimate of
the duration of Armstrong&rsquo;s delirium proved to
be only a few days shorter than the actual fact.
In less than a week all anxiety regarding any possible
complications was set at rest by the doctor&rsquo;s report that
his patient was progressing normally and as well as
could be expected. The skull had sustained no injury,
and the brain suffered only from the concussion. The
household became accustomed to the still figure, which
gave evidence of its returning strength only by the increasing
frequency of incoherent ramblings, the voice
developing in firmness as the days progressed.</p>

<p>Inez was about again by this time, and with sunken
eyes and ashen face shared with Helen the privilege of
watching beside the patient during the last week of his
unconsciousness. But it was a different Inez from the
serious but happy and alert girl who had sat beside
Armstrong in the automobile when it had crashed against
the wall. The burden of bearing her secret alone, during
all these weeks, had been in itself a wearing experience,
but this was as nothing compared with the agony
of soul through which she had since passed. The very
struggle with herself, and the sense of personal sacrifice
she experienced, had previously served in her own mind
to sanctify her affection and to justify its existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Now that she had allowed her passion to burst from her
control, all justification was at an end. Her womanhood
and sense of right seemed to separate themselves from
her weaker emotions, and to judge and condemn them
without mitigation.</p>

<p>It was natural that Helen should attribute her changed
condition to the horror of the accident itself; yet Inez
knew that the scene which was enacted in her mind over
and over again until it almost drove her mad was that
of her own shameless disloyalty. She shuddered as it
returned to her even now while sitting beside Armstrong&rsquo;s
bed; she shrank from Helen&rsquo;s sympathetic caress
and her thoughtful solicitude. If she could only
cry out and proclaim to them all the unworthy part
she had performed, she would feel some sense of relief
in the self-abasement it must bring to her.</p>

<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s delirious wanderings were a sore trial
to Inez, but she accepted and bore them with the unflinching
courage of an ascetic. The sound of his voice,
the undirected, expressionless gaze of his eyes, the uncertainty
of what each disconnected sentence might call
to mind&mdash;all drove fresh barbs into a soul already tortured
by self-condemnation. At first his mind had
seemed to center itself upon his wife and his enforced
separation from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When it is finished,&rdquo; he had murmured, tossing from
side to side and finally raising his hand as if reaching
out to some one&mdash;&ldquo;when it is finished she will understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does understand, dear,&rdquo; Helen had cried out,
seizing his hand and pressing it to her lips; but instantly
he withdrew it, and his words again became incoherent
and meaningless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>At another time, when both Helen and Inez were sitting
near by, his eyes opened, and he seemed to be looking
directly at his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She refuses to continue the work, Helen,&rdquo; he said,
as she sprang to his side, believing that at last his mind
had cleared&mdash;&ldquo;you were quite wrong, do you not see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked at Inez quickly, noting the swift color
which suffused her pale face, but before a word could
be spoken the invalid had relapsed into his former condition.
Inez made an excuse to escape from the room
for a moment. &ldquo;You were quite wrong&mdash;do you not
see?&rdquo; she repeated Armstrong&rsquo;s words to herself. Was
he simply rambling, or had the subject been brought
up for previous discussion? Inez&rsquo; conscience, sensitive
from the load already resting upon it, quivered with new
apprehensiveness. Yet Helen&rsquo;s attitude toward her had
in no way changed&mdash;in fact, the awful anxiety of the
first suspense, together with the later mutual responsibilities
which they had shared, had seemed to Inez to
draw them even more closely to each other. She tried
to gain an answer to her inward questionings from
Helen&rsquo;s face as she re-entered the room, but found
there nothing but cordiality and friendliness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be getting nearer and nearer to a return
of consciousness,&rdquo; Helen had said, quite naturally; &ldquo;but
how he wanders!&rdquo; She looked over affectionately to her
husband, still and helpless, but breathing with the steady
regularity of convalescence. &ldquo;Sometimes it is about
his work at the library&mdash;sometimes it is about me.
What agony of spirit he must be passing through if
he realizes any of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He loves you, Helen,&rdquo; Inez cried, impulsively&mdash;&ldquo;he
loves you now, just as he always has!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Helen looked up questioningly from
her fancy work. She was not yet ready to take Inez
into her confidence. &ldquo;What a strange remark, dear!
Is it not quite natural that my husband should love
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s smiling face, as she asked her simple but
disconcerting question, completely unnerved Inez.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been so worried about the time which his
work compelled him to be away from you,&rdquo; Inez replied,
at length, trying to conceal her confusion. &ldquo;He
finished the first draft of the book the day of the accident.
His first thought, after he put down his pen,
was to return to the villa, that he might surprise you at
lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>!&rdquo; called Armstrong.</p>

<p>Helen placed her hand upon his forehead soothingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owe it to my wife&mdash;&rdquo; the invalid continued; &ldquo;but
I shall come back&mdash;come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, you shall go back,&rdquo; she answered, quietly,
resting her cheek against his&mdash;&ldquo;you shall go
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When it is finished&mdash;&rdquo; Armstrong murmured, again
subsiding into silence.</p>

<p>So the days passed, one by one, differing little, each
from the other, yet filled with many and conflicting emotions
on the part of the faithful watcher by the bedside.
With all its pain, Helen welcomed this period
during which she could work out her problem with the
unconscious help of the rambling, disconnected sentences
which escaped from her husband&rsquo;s lips. Sometimes they
were full of tenderness for her; again they were reproaches,
levelled at himself for his neglect; but most
frequently they made reference to his work in some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
its various stages. Alternately her heart was touched
by his apparent affection for her, and the wound again
torn open by his appeal to or dependence upon Inez.
But through it all came the one conviction, which needed
but this strengthening reassurance to make her determined
path seem certain&mdash;that whatever drew him away
from his work and back to her was a sense of duty, and
that alone.</p>

<p>Helen questioned Dr. Montgomery upon the ordinary
phenomena in cases such as this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mutterings may be absolutely meaningless,&rdquo; he
replied to her questions, &ldquo;or they may be thoughts or
actual repetitions of conversations which he has previously
had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the latter case, would he be likely to repeat them
correctly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, provided he repeats them at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And these thoughts or conversations, if correctly
repeated, would presumably indicate his convictions at
the time they occurred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His convictions at the time they occurred,&rdquo; Dr.
Montgomery assented; &ldquo;but their reliability as normal
expressions would depend upon his mental condition
at the time the thoughts occurred or the words were
spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s recovery came unexpectedly, even after
the long days of waiting. The perfect July day was
drawing to a close, and Helen had watched the sinking
sun from the window beside his bed. It was all so beautiful!
The world seemed full of glorious hopefulness
and promise, and her heart filled to overflowing at the
thought that for her, who loved it so, that promise no
longer held good. She turned to the silent figure lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
upon the bed. Would he ever realize what she had gone
through and must still endure for him? She sank upon
her knees, burying her face in the counterpane, as if to
shut out the overpowering grandeur, which produced so
sad a contrast. Suddenly she felt a hand resting upon
her head, and a voice spoke her name.</p>

<p>She looked up quickly straight into her husband&rsquo;s
eyes, now wide open and filled with an expression so full
of love and devotion that her heart sprang forth in eager
response. It was the expression which his face had worn
when she had first confessed her love for him, and the
intervening months, with their brief joy and their long
sorrow, were obliterated on the instant. Once more he
was the devoted, thoughtful, irresistible lover, and Helen
felt the weight of years roll off her tired shoulders, leaving
her the happy, buoyant girl, proud of having won
this strong man&rsquo;s affection. She gazed at him silently,
fearing lest the eyes close again, and unwilling to lose
a moment of their present significance; but they remained
open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; Armstrong repeated, still looking intently
at her, &ldquo;be patient, dear. I know how shamefully I
have neglected you, I know how much I have hurt you;
but my work is nearly finished now. Then, believe me,
all will be as before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice was calm and sustained. There was no
hesitation, no rambling. Still, she did not fully comprehend
that he was himself again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; she replied, humoring him; &ldquo;then all
will be as before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not see the sharp pain which showed in her
face as she spoke, nor did he realize how her heart wished
that it might be so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I must get up,&rdquo; he continued, after a moment&rsquo;s
silence. &ldquo;What time is it? I shall be late at the
library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have finished your work for to-day, Jack,&rdquo; she
answered, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I?&rdquo; he asked, simply.</p>

<p>His glance slowly wandered about the room. &ldquo;Is it
not morning?&rdquo; he queried, at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is afternoon,&rdquo; she replied, turning toward the
window. &ldquo;See&mdash;the sun is just sinking behind <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San
Miniato</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afternoon?&rdquo; he queried, vaguely&mdash;&ldquo;afternoon, and
I still in bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not been well,&rdquo; she volunteered, guardedly,
carefully following the doctor&rsquo;s injunctions. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
bother now; you will be feeling much better in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not well?&rdquo; Armstrong&rsquo;s mind was groping around
for some familiar landmark upon which to fasten. &ldquo;I
was at the library&mdash;was it this morning?&mdash;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> was
there, Miss Thayer was there&mdash;where is Miss Thayer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She went out only a moment ago. But don&rsquo;t try
to think about it now. It will be much better for you
to do that later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He weakly acquiesced and closed his eyes, still holding
her hand firmly grasped in his own. The doctor
found him gently sleeping, with Helen watching patiently
beside him, when he entered the room an hour
later.</p>

<p>She held up her disengaged hand warningly. &ldquo;He
is himself again,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; replied Dr. Montgomery, with satisfaction.
&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is splendid,&rdquo; he said, when she had recounted
the details; &ldquo;he is progressing famously. You won&rsquo;t
be able to keep him from questioning, but try to let
the awakening come as gradually as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The morning brought renewed strength to the invalid.
The nurse called Helen as soon as Armstrong wakened,
and he plied her with countless interrogations. Uncle
Peabody came in to see him immediately after a light
breakfast had been served, but Inez, upon one pretext
or another, delayed entering the sick-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be better for him to become accustomed to
his new conditions,&rdquo; she urged, when Helen suggested
her going to see him. &ldquo;You and Mr. Cartwright should
have these first moments with him. Later I shall be
only too glad to help in any way I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Armstrong himself was not to be denied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is more to all this than you are telling me,&rdquo;
he said, petulantly, at last, after learning from Helen
and Uncle Peabody such details as he could draw forth
regarding the duration of his illness and its general
nature. &ldquo;I remember now leaving the library in the
motor-car with Miss Thayer. We went&mdash;where did we
go? Oh yes; to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Domenico</span>. Then we came home.
Did we come home?&rdquo; he asked, with uncertainty in his
voice; but before an answer could be given he had himself
supplied the connecting link.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he cried, raising himself upon his elbow&mdash;&ldquo;there
was an accident. Alfonse tried to take that
turn at the foot of the hill, and we smashed against the
wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Helen assented, trying to calm his rising excitement,
&ldquo;there was an accident, and you were badly
hurt; but you are nearly well now. Please go slowly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Jack, or you will undo all that your long rest has accomplished.
There is plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Miss Thayer,&rdquo; he replied, not heeding her admonition
and glancing about searchingly. &ldquo;Where is
Miss Thayer? She was injured, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not seriously,&rdquo; Helen reassured him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but she is not far away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not sent her away while I have been ill?&rdquo;
he asked, with a touch of his former suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jack.&rdquo; All of the tired, strained tone came
back in Helen&rsquo;s voice as she turned away from the bed
to conceal her disappointment.</p>

<p>Armstrong sensed it all as he had failed to do at other
times since the gap had begun to widen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean that, Helen,&rdquo; he said, and reaching
over he took her hand and drew her to him; &ldquo;I really
did not mean it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all right, Jack,&rdquo; Helen replied, withdrawing
her hand and trying to smile; &ldquo;I will find Inez and
send her to you.&rdquo; And before he could remonstrate
she had left the room.</p>

<p>While he waited Armstrong had a brief moment of
introspection. Again he had wounded her, and for no
cause. He had enjoyed the short period since his
awakening, particularly on account of the tender and
affectionate care Helen had given him, which she had
for a long time withheld because of his own self-centred
interest. It was with real regret that he found this
little visit with his wife so abruptly brought to an end,
yet he himself had forced the termination. He must
fight against this unfortunate attribute, he told himself,
and show Helen his real feelings toward her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>His reveries were interrupted by Inez&rsquo; entrance. Silently
she stood beside him, holding out her hand, which
he quietly grasped for a moment and then released. He
wondered at the color in her face and at her apparent
unwillingness to meet his glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They tell me we have been through an accident together,&rdquo;
he said, slowly. &ldquo;Thank God it was I who
was injured and not you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez turned from him, closing her eyes involuntarily.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it!&rdquo; she cried, impulsively; &ldquo;it was too
awful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is all over now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All but the memory,&rdquo; she replied, faintly. &ldquo;Let us
forget it, I beg of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to ask you for some of the details,&rdquo;
Armstrong continued, &ldquo;which you alone can give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg of you,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;I could not
bear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then by all means let us forget it,&rdquo; he replied,
curiously affected by the girl&rsquo;s emotion. &ldquo;Perhaps some
time later you will feel more like talking about it. You
see, I can remember nothing after the crash against the
wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; cried Inez, passionately, turning
away her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is better so,&rdquo; Armstrong assented, still
wondering at the intensity of her emotion. &ldquo;But when
one has had a whole fortnight of his life blotted out, he
naturally feels a bit of curiosity concerning what happened
during all that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. You don&rsquo;t
know how this tortures me, and I really cannot bear
it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Armstrong watched the girl as she turned and fairly
fled from the room, completely mystified by her extraordinary
attitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world can have happened?&rdquo; he asked
himself; and then he settled back on the pillow and tried
to answer his own question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XXV</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>There is no place like the sick-room for self-examination
and introspection. In the still monotony
of the slow-passing days, the invalid&rsquo;s mind is freed
from the conventions of every-day complexities, and can
view its problems with a veracity and a clearness at other
times impossible. As Armstrong&rsquo;s convalescence continued,
he marshalled before him certain events which
had occurred since his arrival in Florence, and examined
them with great minuteness. Some of these seemed
trivial, and he wondered why they came back at this
time and forced themselves upon him with such persistence;
some of them were important, and he realized
that Helen had much of which she might justly complain.</p>

<p>His eyes followed her as she moved about the room,
quick to anticipate each wish or necessity, and sweetly
eager to respond; yet he distinctly felt the barrier between
them. He was conscious now that this barrier
had existed for some time, and he found it difficult to
explain to himself why he had only recently become
aware of it. Helen&rsquo;s conversations with him came back
with renewed force and vital meaning. He had resented
it when she had told him that his work at the library
had made him indifferent to everything else, yet she
had been quite right in what she said. He had wilfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
misunderstood her efforts to bring him back to himself,
and had openly blamed her for faults which existed
only in his own neglect. He had accused her of being
jealous of his intimacy with Miss Thayer, yet her
attitude toward Inez was a constant refutation. He
had treated her even with incivility and unpardonable
irritability.</p>

<p>The fault was his, he admitted, yet were there not
extenuating circumstances? No one could have foreseen
how completely engrossed he was to become in his
work, or the extent of the mastery which the spell of
this old-time learning was to gain over him. Naturally,
he would have avoided it had he foreseen it; but once
under its influence he had been carried forward irresistibly,
unable to withdraw, unwilling to oppose.
And yet he had boasted of his strength!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have become infinitely bigger and stronger and
grander,&rdquo; Helen had said to him, even when her heart
was breaking, &ldquo;and I admire you just so much the
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong winced as these words came home to him.
With so much real cause for complaint and upbraiding,
Helen had gently tried to show him his shortcomings,
tempering her comment with expressions full of loyalty
and affection.</p>

<p>But on one point she had been wholly wrong. It was
natural that she should have misinterpreted the intimacy
which a community of interests had brought about between
Miss Thayer and himself. Inez was, of course,
much stronger intellectually than Helen, and by reason
of this was far better fitted to assist him in his own intellectual
expressions. But their intimacy had never
extended beyond this even in thought or suggestion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Helen had insisted that Inez was in love with him, and
he had tried to show her the absurdity of her suspicion.
Here, at least, he had been in the right. Throughout
their close association, and even after Helen had spoken,
he had never discovered the slightest evidence that any
such affection existed. The still unexplained remarks
of the contessa&rsquo;s might or might not be significant.
Emory, of course, was prejudiced, and his comments
did not require serious consideration. Miss Thayer&rsquo;s
refusal to continue the work, the comparative infrequency
of her visits to his sick-chamber&mdash;in fact, everything
went to show how far Helen had wandered from
the actual facts.</p>

<p>Armstrong found some comfort in this conclusion.
With Helen so unquestionably wrong in this hypothesis,
it of course went without saying that she was equally
wrong in what she had said later. She believed that
he had a career before him. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> had said the same
thing, Miss Thayer had said so&mdash;and Armstrong himself
believed, in the consciousness of having completed
an unusual piece of work, that such a possibility might
exist. He felt no conceit, but rather that overpowering
sense of hopefulness which comes to a man as a result
of successful endeavor&mdash;not yet crowned, but completed
to his own satisfaction. If this career was to be his,
he could not follow Helen&rsquo;s assumption that it must
separate them. That was, of course, as ridiculous as
her feelings about Inez. Success for him must mean
the same to her, his wife. When the right time came
he would take up these two points specifically with her
and show her the error which had misled her.</p>

<p>This self-examination covered several days. At first
Armstrong found himself unable to think long at a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
without becoming mentally wearied; but by degrees his
mind gained in vigor, and proved fully equal to the demands
made upon it. The details of what had happened
on the day of the accident came back to him one by one
up to the point of the accident itself, but he felt annoyed
that he could not learn more of this. From Helen,
Uncle Peabody, and the doctor he knew of the early belief
that he had been killed and of the excitement caused
by his revived respiration. Of his period of delirium,
the nurse had given him more information than the
others; but of the break between the moment when the
car struck the wall, and the time when Helen arrived
upon the scene, Miss Thayer alone held the key. Armstrong&rsquo;s
curiosity regarding this interval was, perhaps,
heightened by the evident aversion which she felt to discussing
it. To mention the subject in her presence was
certain to drive her from the room, her face blazing
with color, her body trembling in every nerve.</p>

<p>The patient was able to move about a little by this
time, and at the close of each day he found relief from
the monotony of his room and the veranda by short
walks in the garden, rich in its midsummer gorgeousness
of color. A couch had been placed near the retaining
wall, so that he could rest upon it whenever he felt
fatigued. Between his solicitude concerning the situation
with Helen, and his determination to discover from
Miss Thayer the occasion of her remarkable attitude,
his thoughts were fully occupied.</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon Armstrong had thrown
himself upon the couch, and for a moment closed his
eyes. With no warning he saw a scene enacted before
his mental vision in which he himself was the central
figure. He was lying still and lifeless upon the grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
by the roadside at the foot of the hill. Four other
figures were in the picture. He recognized Inez, but
the other women and the boy he had never seen. The
figures moved about, as in a kinetoscope. One of the
women ran into the cottage and returned with a basin
of water. Inez knelt beside him and bathed his forehead.
He could see the tense expression on her face. She
seemed to speak to the women, but he could distinguish
no words. Then he saw himself lifted and carried into
the cottage. At this point the picture disappeared as
suddenly as it had come.</p>

<p>Armstrong opened his eyes when he found the picture
gone, and sat up, gazing about him excitedly. He saw
Inez crossing the veranda and called to her abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he cried, as she hastened to obey the summons
and before she reached him, &ldquo;who carried me into
the cottage after the accident?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl paled at the suddenness and intensity of the
question. &ldquo;There were four of us,&rdquo; she said, faintly&mdash;&ldquo;two
peasant women, a boy, and myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong passed his hand over his forehead and
gazed at Inez intently. So far, then, his vision had been
correct. Breathlessly he pursued his interrogations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before that did one of the women bring some water
from the cottage, and did you kneel beside me and bathe
my face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Who has told you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it all happened just like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; Inez was trembling, vaguely apprehensive.</p>

<p>Armstrong rose. &ldquo;Why, as you have just said,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;You know I have been trying to get you to
tell me about it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are unkind,&rdquo; Inez retorted, quickly. &ldquo;You
know how much all mention of this pains me, yet you
persist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me.&rdquo; Armstrong controlled himself and
held out his hand kindly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to hurt you,
believe me, but my mind is ever searching out that connecting
link. You won&rsquo;t tell me about it, so I suppose
I shall never find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started to reply, but as quickly checked herself.
&ldquo;There is nothing for me to tell,&rdquo; she said, at length,
without looking up. &ldquo;I will send Helen to you,&rdquo; she
added, as she hastened away.</p>

<p>Armstrong again threw himself upon the couch, and,
trying to assume the same position, closed his eyes in a
vain endeavor to summon back the vision he had seen.
If it had only continued a little longer he might have
learned all! The fugitive nature of his quest proved a
fascination, and day after day he exerted every effort
to gratify his whim.</p>

<p>Inez clearly avoided him. Whether or not this was
apparent to the other members of the family he could
not tell, but it was quite obvious to him. There must
be some reason beyond what he knew, and he had almost
stumbled upon it! Another week passed by, more
rapidly than any since his convalescence began because
of the determination with which he pursued his baffling
problem.</p>

<p>Again he lay upon his couch in the garden, his eyes
closed, but with his mind fixed upon its one desire. Suddenly
he felt the presence of some one. A thrill of expectation
passed through him, but he dared not open
his eyes lest the impression should disappear. For what
seemed a long time he was conscious of this person standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
beside him, and he knew that whoever it might be
was gazing at him intently. Then he felt a hand gently
take his arm, which was hanging over the side of
the couch, and, raising it carefully, place it in a more
comfortable position. Then the hand rested for a
moment on his forehead.</p>

<p>Opening his eyes a little, as if by intuition, he saw
Miss Thayer tiptoeing along the path toward the house.
He closed his eyes again, and as he did so he felt a sudden
return of the subconscious impression.</p>

<p>Now, in his mind&rsquo;s eye he saw a cheaply furnished
room, and Miss Thayer leaning, with ashen face and
dishevelled hair, against a closed door. He saw her
sink upon the floor and pass through a paroxysm of
grief. She murmured some incoherent words, and then
stood erect, looking straight at him as he lay upon the
bed. Then she lifted his arm, just as she had a moment
before, and covered his hand with kisses, sobbing
the while with no attempt at control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak to me!&rdquo; he seemed to hear her say. &ldquo;Tell
me that you are not dead!&rdquo; He could feel the intensity
of her gaze even as he lay there. &ldquo;Jack, my beloved;
you are mine, dear&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;and I am yours.&rdquo;
Beads of perspiration gathered on his forehead. &ldquo;How
I have loved you all these weeks!... Now I can tell
you of it, dear&mdash;it will do no harm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Held by a force he could not have broken had he
wished, Armstrong watched the progress of the tragedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling, my beloved!&rdquo; he heard Inez whisper;
&ldquo;open your eyes just once, and tell me that I may call
you mine if only for this one terrible moment.... This
is our moment, dear&mdash;no one can take it from
us!... Have you not seen how I have loved you, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
I have struggled to keep you from knowing it?... Jack!
Jack! this is the beginning and the end!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could endure the scene no longer. With a look
of horror on his face, he sprang to his feet and glanced
about him. He was alone in the garden. He stumbled
rather than walked to the retaining wall, and rested
against it for support.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; he cried, aloud, &ldquo;have I regained my
mind only to lose it again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced toward the house. There was no one in
sight, but Helen was playing Debussy&rsquo;s &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Claire de
Lune</span>&rdquo; upon the piano in the hall, and the sound of the
music soothed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreams&mdash;hallucinations,&rdquo; he repeated to himself.
&ldquo;God! what an experience!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XXVI</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>With Armstrong&rsquo;s convalescence progressing so
satisfactorily, Helen returned to her music with
a clear conscience. She was determined that
the influence upon him of her personal presence should
be reduced as nearly as possible to a minimum. Naturally,
during the period of his illness and the attendant
weakness, she had been with him almost constantly;
naturally he had turned to her with what seemed to be
his former affection. But the die was cast, and the accident
which for the time being interrupted the progress
of events predestined to occur could in no way prevent
their final accomplishment. Helen thought often of
Uncle Peabody&rsquo;s optimistic suggestion that the present
condition was bound to straighten matters out, but
she refused to be buoyed up by false hopes, only to
suffer a harder blow when once again Armstrong became
what she believed to be himself. She saw no gain
in tuning up the heart-strings to their former pitch,
when neither she nor Jack could again play upon them
with any degree of harmony.</p>

<p>Helen was with her husband for whatever portion of
the day he needed her, whether it was to read aloud to
him, or to converse, or to wander about the garden.
She served each meal to him with her own hands, and
watched the progress of his improvement so carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
that nothing remained undone. Yet, with deliberate intention,
she was with him no more than this. Whenever
she found him interested in something or with some one
who engaged his attention for the time being, she slipped
away so quietly that he scarcely noticed it and devoted
herself to her own interests, which she was desperately
trying to make fill the void in her life. Her music was
her greatest solace, for in it she found a response to
her every mood. In the dim-lit hall of the villa she
sat for hours at the piano, her fingers running over the
keys, her mind pondering upon her complex problem&mdash;each
action apparently separated from the other, yet in
exact accord. Sometimes it was a nocturne of Chopin&rsquo;s,
sometimes an impromptu of Schubert&rsquo;s; but always she
found in the unspoken, poetic expression of the composer&rsquo;s
soul an answering sympathy which was lacking
in other forms more tangible.</p>

<p>Inez interrupted one of these communions, when Helen
supposed herself alone with Debussy. Lately she had
found herself turning to the charm and mystery of his
atmosphere, the strangeness of his idiom, the vagueness
of his rhythms, and the fugitive grace and fancy of his
harmonic expression with an understanding and a surrender
which she had never before felt. The music reflected
upon her its delicate perception of nature in
all its moods&mdash;the splash of the waves upon the shore,
the roaring of the surf, the gloom of the forests relieved
by the moonlight on the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Helen&mdash;I beg of you!&rdquo; Inez exclaimed, suddenly.
&ldquo;Say it to me, but don&rsquo;t torture me with those
weird reproaches. Every note almost drives me wild!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Inez, dear!&rdquo; cried Helen, startled by the girl&rsquo;s
words no less than by the suddenness of the interruption.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
&ldquo;What in the world do you mean? You should have
told me before if my playing affected you so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love it, Helen,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;but lately it has
hurt me through and through. I can hear your voice
echoing in every note you strike, and I feel its bitter
reproach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen tried to draw Inez beside her, but the girl sank
upon the floor, resting her elbows on Helen&rsquo;s knees and
looking up into her face with tense earnestness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been terribly unstrung these days, dear,&rdquo;
Helen replied, &ldquo;and you are unstrung now or you would
not discover what does not exist. It is your instinctive
sympathy for poor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mlisande</span> that makes you feel so&mdash;you
see her, as I do, floating resistlessly over the terraces
and fountains, the plaything of Fate, a phantom of
love and longing and uncertainty. That is what you
feel, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen took Inez&rsquo; face between her hands and looked
into her eyes for a moment. &ldquo;People call it mystical
and unreal,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;but I believe that some of
us have it in our own lives, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez did not reply directly, and struggled to escape
the searching gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; she said, abruptly, &ldquo;I simply cannot stay
on here; I shall go mad if I do. Each time I suggest
going you say that you need me, and it seems ungrateful,
after all you have done for me, to speak as I do.
But you cannot understand. I am not myself, and I
am getting into a condition which will make me a burden
to you instead of a help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do need you, dear,&rdquo; Helen replied, quietly, &ldquo;but
certainly not at the expense either of your health or
your happiness. The effects of the accident have lasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
much longer than I thought they would. I wanted you
to be quite recovered before you left us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the accident were all!&rdquo; moaned Inez, burying her
face in Helen&rsquo;s lap.</p>

<p>Helen made no response, but laid her hand kindly
upon Inez&rsquo; head. After a few moments the girl straightened
up. Her eyes burned with the intensity of her
sudden resolve, and she spoke rapidly, as if fearful that
her courage would prove insufficient for the task she had
set for herself to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I am going to tell you something
which will make you hate me. You will want me
to leave you, and our friendship will be forever ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, dear,&rdquo; urged Helen&mdash;&ldquo;wait until you are
calmer; then, if you choose, tell me all that you have in
your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I must tell you now. I love Jack, Helen&mdash;do
you understand? I love your husband, and, fight it as
I do, I cannot help it. Think of having to make a confession
like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s face lighted up with glad relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad that you have told me this,&rdquo; she said,
quietly.</p>

<p>Inez gazed at Helen in wonder, amazed by her calmness
and her unexpected words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must tell you more,&rdquo; she continued, wildly;
&ldquo;I have loved him for weeks&mdash;almost since I first came
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you have, Inez.&rdquo; Helen pressed a kiss upon
the girl&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;I have known it for a long time;
but I have also seen your struggle against it, and your
loyalty to me&mdash;and to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have known it?&rdquo; Inez asked, faintly. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
her voice strengthened again. &ldquo;But you have not known
all! I did fight against it, as you say, and I was loyal
until&rdquo;&mdash;her voice broke for a moment&mdash;&ldquo;until that day
of the accident&mdash;in the cottage&mdash;I thought him dead&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; encouraged Helen, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until then I was loyal, but when I was alone with
him, and thought him dead, I&mdash;oh, Helen, you will hate
me as I hate myself&mdash;then I kissed him, and I told him
of my love, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, dear,&rdquo; Helen interrupted, her voice
full of tenderness. &ldquo;No one can blame you for what
you did under such awful circumstances. I suspected
what had happened when I found you where you had
fainted across his body. But you can&rsquo;t imagine how
glad I am that you have told me all this. I felt sure
you would, some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will let me go now, won&rsquo;t you? You can see
how impossible it is for me to stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need you now more than ever,&rdquo; replied Helen,
firmly. &ldquo;If you insist on leaving I shall not urge you
to stay, but even you&mdash;knowing what you do&mdash;cannot
know how much I need you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; Inez asked, weakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what Ferdy said first, then from what I saw
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you not send me away, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no right to do so, Inez.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you were perfectly sure of Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen winced. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, quietly; &ldquo;I was
sure of Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you understand now that I really cannot
stay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack needs you still.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No; his manuscript is complete. He will not need
me for the revision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would stay if he did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then if you would stay if he needed you, surely you
will do the same for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Helen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you? When Jack is quite himself again I
will urge no longer. Now that you have told me this,
it will be easier for you. Will you not do this for
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing I would not do for you, Helen!&rdquo;
cried Inez, throwing her arms impulsively around her
friend&rsquo;s neck and kissing her passionately. &ldquo;You are
so strong you make me more ashamed than ever of my
own weakness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, dear,&rdquo; Helen replied, simply, returning
her embrace; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t make any mistake about
my strength. It is because I lack it so sadly that I ask
you to stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="r3">Dr. Montgomery found Armstrong&rsquo;s temperature considerably
higher when he called later in the day, after
the disquieting mental experience his patient had passed
through. Armstrong also appeared to be preoccupied,
and more interested in asking questions than in answering
them. For the first time he seemed to be curious in
regard to the nature of his illness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a case like mine, is it possible for the mental convalescence
to be retarded or to go backward?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dr. Montgomery replied, &ldquo;it is possible, but
hardly probable, especially with a patient who has
progressed so normally as you have.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is normal for the memory to have a complete
lapse, as in my case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible for a knowledge of the events which
occurred during such a lapse to be restored&mdash;say, weeks
afterward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; under certain conditions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And those conditions are?&rdquo; asked Armstrong,
eagerly.</p>

<p>The doctor settled back in his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see if I can make it clear to you: all memories
are permanent&mdash;that is to say, every event makes
a distinct, even though it may be an unconscious, impression
upon the brain. Sometimes these memories
remain dormant for months, or even years, before something
occurs to bring them to mind; but even before
this the memories are there, just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are speaking of every-day occurrences, are
you not? My question is whether or not it might be
possible for me, for example, to have a reviving knowledge
of certain events which took place during a period
of apparent unconsciousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand. Yes, it would be quite possible for
this to happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would be necessary to bring it about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Montgomery smiled at his patient&rsquo;s earnestness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you so eager to recall that period? But the
question is a fair one. Some incident must take place
similar to something which occurred during the unconscious
period in order to revive the dormant memory.
I doubt if you could do it deliberately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no intention of trying,&rdquo; Armstrong replied;
&ldquo;but I am interested in this particular phase of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
case. Suppose, during the apparently unconscious period,
some one had lifted my arm or placed a hand upon
my forehead&mdash;would the same act be enough to restore
the dormant memory, as you call it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite enough&mdash;though it would not necessarily do
so. I have known several cases where the repetition of
such an act has produced just the result which you describe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And these revived impressions are apt to be trustworthy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a photographic plate,&rdquo; replied the doctor, emphatically.</p>

<p>Armstrong was silent for some moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an interesting phase, as you say,&rdquo; he remarked,
at length. &ldquo;I think I may try the experiment, after
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chances will be against you; but I imagine you
have been pretty well informed of what has happened.
Don&rsquo;t try to think too hard. It will be all the better
for you to give your brain a little rest; it has had a
hard shaking-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So this was the solution of the mystery for which
he had sought so long! Armstrong found himself in
a curious position after the doctor took his departure,
leaving behind him a new knowledge of affairs which,
six hours before, his patient would have considered absolutely
preposterous. Helen was right, and had been
right from the beginning. His one consolation was removed,
and in its place was a complication which seemed
past straightening out. To the blame which Armstrong
had already taken to himself on Helen&rsquo;s account, he
must now add the responsibility of having inspired this
sentiment in Inez&rsquo; heart, which meant unhappiness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
all. Even though this had been done unconsciously, he
told himself, it was no less culpable in that he had not
himself discovered the situation and checked it before
any serious harm had been done. Helen had seen it,
the contessa had seen it, and he wondered how many
others. He had been blind in this, criminally blind, and
now he must pay the penalty.</p>

<p>But this penalty could not be borne by him alone&mdash;he
could see that clearly. Helen and Inez were both
hopelessly involved. And what a woman his wife had
shown herself to be! Knowing of this affection on the
part of Inez, she had suffered them to continue together
in order that his work might not be disturbed. She had
told him just how matters stood&mdash;not with recriminations,
but with loving solicitude, offering to sacrifice
herself, if necessary, to secure his happiness, drinking
her cup of sorrow to the dregs, and alone! It was plain
enough to him now. He thought of Helen as she was
when they first came to Florence, and compared her
with the Helen of to-day. He had brought about that
change; he alone was responsible for it. She had craved
the present, with its sunshine, its birds, its happiness,
and instead of all this he had filled it for her with nothing
but sorrow and suffering! He merited the scoring
Emory gave him, even though the denunciation had gone
too far.</p>

<p>As the bandage fell from his eyes, the character which
he had assumed during these past months stood out clearly
before him, shorn of its academic halo, and pitiful in
its unfulfilled ideals. He had sought to join that company
of humanists who had awakened the world to the
joy and beauty of intellectual attainment. He had believed
himself worthy of this honor, in that he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
he had understood and sympathized with their underlying
motives. So he had in principle, but how wofully
he had failed in his efforts to carry them out! Instead
of assimilating the happy youthfulness of the Greek, together
with the Grecian harmony of existence, he had
developed his morbid self-centering and self-consciousness.
His blind, unreasoning devotion to his single interest
had resulted in folly and fanaticism. He had
overlooked the cardinal element in the humanistic creed
that knowledge without love meant death and isolation.
Instead of singling out and joining together the beauties
for which humanism stood, he had embraced and
emphasized its limitations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am an impostor!&rdquo; Armstrong exclaimed, no longer
able to endure his mental lashing in silence&mdash;&ldquo;an arrant
impostor! I have set myself up as a modern apostle,
I have written platitudes upon intellectual supremacy
and the religion of knowledge, when the one single personal
attribute to which I can justly lay claim is insufferable
academic arrogance. I have seized a half-truth
and fortified it with fact; and in accomplishing
this stupendous piece of fatuous nonsense I have stultified
myself and destroyed the happiness of all!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XXVII</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s first act, on the following day, was
to send to the library for his manuscript. Helen
looked upon this as an evidence that with his returning
strength had also come a return of his all-controlling
passion. This was a natural explanation of the
peculiar change which she had noticed in him during the
past few days, and his request fitted in so perfectly with
a conversation between Uncle Peabody and herself the
evening before that she almost unconsciously exchanged
with him a glance of mutual understanding.</p>

<p>But the real motive was quite at variance with her
interpretation. Armstrong had passed through his period
of introspection without taking any one into his confidence.
Fierce as the struggle had been, he felt instinctively
that his only chance of restoring conditions
to anything which even approached equilibrium was to
make no new false step. He had come to certain definite
conclusions, but was still undecided as to the proper
methods to be adopted in his attempt to turn these conclusions
into realities.</p>

<p>First of all, he had placed himself in an entirely false
position with Helen. He had given her cause to believe
him indifferent and neglectful. This, at least, he
argued, could be remedied, even though it was now too
late to spare her the suffering through which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
passed. But he could explain it all, and by his future
devotion to her, and to those interests of which she was
a part, he could make her forget the past.</p>

<p>With Miss Thayer the proposition was a different
one. To her he had done an injury which could not be
repaired. He had sought to take her with him into a
world full of those possibilities which the intellectual
alone can comprehend. Instead of leaving her there,
inspired by the wisdom of such an intercourse, he had&mdash;unconsciously
but still culpably&mdash;developed in her an
interest in himself. The problem was to extricate her
and himself from this compromising situation without
destroying all future self-respect for them both; and the
solution of it seemed far beyond his reach.</p>

<p>And besides all this, there was the manuscript. Despite
his best endeavor, he could not recall even an outline
of what he had written. After a full realization
came to him of the extent to which he had misunderstood
and misconstrued the basic principles of humanism itself,
his interest in his work became one of curiosity to
learn by actual examination how far he had accepted the
half-truths, and how far he had wandered from the path
which he had thought he knew so well. The whole volume
must be filled with absurd theories, falsely conceived
and as falsely expressed. He must go over it, page by
page, and learn from it the bitter fact of his unworthiness
to stand as the modern expounder of those great
minds whose influence alone should have been enough to
hold him to his appointed course.</p>

<p>When the manuscript arrived he devoted himself to it
with an eagerness which added to the natural misunderstanding
of his motive. With no word of comment, he
took the package to his room, where, after bolting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
door, he opened it and applied himself to his task.
Hours passed by, but he refused to be interrupted.
Helen tried to persuade him to come down-stairs for
luncheon, but he begged to be excused. Uncle Peabody
calmed her anxiety; so the day passed, leaving him alone
with his burdens.</p>

<p>Armstrong approached his manuscript with bitterness
of spirit. This was the tangible form of that inexplicable
force which had drawn him away from those ties which
stood to him for all future peace and serenity; this had
been the medium which had fostered the new affection
so fraught with sorrow and even danger; this was the
proof of his absolute lack of harmony with those noble
principles which he still felt, when rightly expressed,
represented the highest possibilities of life itself. At
first he hesitated to read it, dreading what it must disclose.
Then he attacked it fiercely, passing from page
to page with feverish intensity.</p>

<p>As he read, his bitterness and dread disappeared, and
in their place came first surprise and then amazement.
Was this his manuscript? Had he written these pages
in which the real, wholesome, glorious spirit of past
attainment and present possibilities fairly lived and
breathed! His amazement turned into absolute mystification.
He read of the important movement which
liberated the rich humanities of Greece and Rome from
the proscription of the Church; he saw literature itself
expand in subject and in quantity; he himself felt the
sundering of the bonds of ignorance, superstition, and
tradition which had previously confined intellectual life
on all sides.</p>

<p>Surely this was a simple yet sane presentation of the
subject, Armstrong said to himself, as it had formulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
itself in words after his long study. His error must lie
in his application of it to the people. The manuscript
unfolded rapidly under his eager inspection. It told
him of the great step forward when writing changed
to printing. He followed the convincing argument that
this new art from its earliest beginnings was to be identical
with that of culture, and a faithful index to the standards
of the ages to come. It told him that the advent
of the printing-press made men think, and gave them
the opportunity of studying description and argument
where previously they had merely gazed at pictorial
design. He could see the development of the people
under this new influence, growing strong in self-reliance,
and confident in their increasing power.</p>

<p>He found himself unable to condemn his work thus
far. In application, as in definition, what he had written
seemed to ring true. Later on he must find expressions
of those distorted ideals in the manuscript, just
as he had found them in himself. With increasing interest
he read of the benefits these people of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">quattrocento</i>
reaped from the principles of Grecian civilization,
now tempered by the inevitable filtering through the
great minds of a century. With no uncertain note the
manuscript portrayed the efforts made by this people
to reach the unattainable, refusing to be bound down by
limited ideals, and creating masterpieces in every art
which expressed in the highest form the ethical spirit of
the period.</p>

<p>The pages still turned rapidly. At times Armstrong
became so absorbed that he forgot himself and the fact
that he was analyzing the outpouring of his own soul.
Then he recalled the present and the problem before
him. He could not comprehend that this work was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
own; he did not remember writing it; he was ignorant of
the particular study or reasoning which had brought
it forth. But there the words stood, in his own handwriting,
a visible evidence of something which had
actually taken place.</p>

<p>As the reading progressed, he became more and more
bewildered. It was direct and convincing. The subject
was handled with restraint, and yet he felt the force
behind each sentence. Suddenly his eye fell upon this
paragraph:</p>

<p>&ldquo;After giving due credit to humanism for its vast
contribution to the arts and to literature, there yet remains
to acknowledge the greatest debt of all: it taught
man to hold himself open to truth from every side,
and so to assimilate it that it became a part of his
very life itself. Thus making himself inclusive of
all about him, his attitude toward his fellow-man
could not be other than sympathetic and appreciative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong read this over a second time, and, bending
forward, he rested his head upon his hands in the midst
of the sheets of manuscript and groaned aloud. This
was his acknowledgment of the great lesson of humanism,
and yet he had not applied it to his own every-day
life! &ldquo;It taught man to hold himself open to truth
from every side,&rdquo; he repeated to himself. &ldquo;Thus making
himself inclusive of all about him, his attitude toward
his fellow-man could not be other than sympathetic
and appreciative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At length he raised his head, and, rising wearily, he
walked to the window, drawing in the refreshing air.
The strain had been intense, and he found himself utterly
exhausted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I see it all,&rdquo; he said, bitterly; &ldquo;the fault is not with
the book or with the principles themselves&mdash;it is with
me! I have written better than I knew; I have preached
where I have not practised. Oh, Helen&mdash;oh, Inez! Can
I ever undo the wrong I have done you both!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XXVIII</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>It was several days before Armstrong found himself
ready to take up the unravelling of the thread. The
shuttle had moved to and fro so silently, and its web
was woven with so intricate a pattern, that he felt the
hopelessness even of finding an end of the yarn, where
he might begin his work. He watched the two girls in
their every-day life as they moved about him; he studied
them carefully, he compared their personal characteristics.
Both were greatly changed. Miss Thayer continued
ill at ease and unlike her former self in her relations
to Helen and Uncle Peabody as well as toward
himself. He felt that now he understood the reason; and
beyond this it was natural that she should miss the absorbing
interest which the work had given her, coming,
as it did, to so abrupt an end and leaving nothing which
could take its place.</p>

<p>But Helen had changed more. The girlish vivacity
which had previously characterized her had disappeared,
and in its place had come a quiet, reposeful dignity
which, while it made her seem an older woman, would
have appealed to him as wonderfully becoming save for
the restraint which accompanied it. She held herself absolutely
in hand. Her every action, while considerate
in its relation to others, admitted of no denial. Armstrong
felt instinctively rather than because of anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
which had happened that were their wills to clash now
hers would prove the stronger. There had been a development
in her far beyond anything he had realized.</p>

<p>Comparing the two, as he had ample opportunity to
do, he wondered if he had made a fair estimate of her
strength in his previous considerations. Helen had considered
herself unfitted to enter into his work with him.
She had frankly stated her unwillingness to go back into
the past, and to live among its memories, when the present
offered an alternative which was to her so much more
attractive. Inez seized with avidity the opportunity he
offered, and had entered into his work with an enthusiasm
second only to his own. Suppose Helen had done
this, Armstrong asked himself. With her characteristics,
as he was only now coming to understand them,
she would not long have remained content to act as his
agent&mdash;she would have become a definite part of the
work herself, and would have helped to shape it, instead
of yielding more and more to his own personality. Inez
had helped him much, and his obligation to her was not
overlooked; but he could see how this helpfulness had
lessened, day by day, as her intellect had become subservient
to his own. He had been glad of this at the
time, but now he found himself asking whether Helen
would not have shown greater strength under the same
circumstances.</p>

<p>Since his accident the contrast had been greater.
Helen had assumed definite control over everything.
Inez, Uncle Peabody, Armstrong himself recognized in
her, without expression, the acknowledged and undisputed
head of affairs. It had all come about so naturally,
and Helen herself seemed so unconscious of it,
that he could not explain it. On the other hand, Inez<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
had completely lost her nerve. The crisis through which
the two girls had passed had produced upon them vastly
differing effects, and Armstrong could not fail to be
impressed by the result of his observations.</p>

<p>Finally he determined to talk the matter over with
Helen, and here again he found himself counting upon
her assistance in straightening things out with Inez.
Had he realized it, this was the first time in his life
that he had admitted even to himself that any one could
aid him in any matter which he could not personally
control. Dimly, it is true, but still definitely, he was
conscious that he was making an unusual admission, yet
he experienced a certain amount of gratification in doing
so.</p>

<p>Helen had been reading aloud to him while he reclined
upon his couch in a shady corner of the veranda.
For some moments he had heard nothing of the spoken
words, for his eyes, resting fixedly upon his wife&rsquo;s face,
revealed to him a more impressive story than that contained
within the printed volume. How beautiful she
was! The clear-cut profile; the long lashes hiding from
him the deep, responsive eyes, whose sympathy he well
knew; the soft, sweet voice which fell upon his ear with
soothing cadence; the whole harmonious bearing, indicative
of a character well defined, yet unconscious of its
strength&mdash;all combined to show him at a single glance
how rare a woman she really was. As he watched her
the definition which he himself had written came back
to him with tremendous force. &ldquo;It taught man to hold
himself open to truth from every side. Thus making
himself inclusive of all about him, his attitude toward his
fellow-man could not be other than sympathetic and appreciative.&rdquo;
What man or woman had he ever known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
who so truly lived up to this high standard as this girl
who sat beside him, all unconscious of the tumult raging
in his mind?</p>

<p>Then the storm passed from his brain to his heart.
His affection, intensified by the struggles he had experienced,
overpowered him, and he cried aloud in a voice
which startled Helen by the suddenness of its appeal.
Seizing her disengaged hand, he pressed it passionately
to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t read any more,&rdquo; he begged; &ldquo;I must talk
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startled almost to a degree of alarm, she laid down
the book, regarding him intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you ever forgive me for all I have made you
suffer?&rdquo; he continued, in the same tense voice; &ldquo;can you
ever believe that my forgetfulness of everything which
was due you was not deliberate, but the result of some
force beyond my control?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked at him steadily for a moment before
replying. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, at length, making a desperate
effort to preserve her composure; &ldquo;I forgive you
gladly. Shall we go on with the story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he replied, almost fiercely, seizing the volume
and placing it beyond her reach upon the couch. &ldquo;I
have been waiting for this moment too long, and now
nothing shall take it from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen realized that it was also the moment for which
she had been waiting, and which she had been dreading
beyond expression. Now he would comprehend
what she had meant, now he would struggle with
her to prevent her from doing what she knew she
must do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need of explanation, Jack,&rdquo; she said, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
length. &ldquo;I understand everything, and have understood
for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you believe that I myself have only recently
come to a realization?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it has come to you sooner than I had expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you believe how sincerely pained I am that all
this should have happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never for a moment thought that you would
intentionally hurt me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you do understand, and will forget?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong sat up on the edge of the couch and watched
Helen&rsquo;s face intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you are asking,&rdquo; she replied,
dropping her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I want to blot out the
memory of every pang I have caused you by a devotion
beyond anything you have ever dreamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Jack,&rdquo; protested Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? Don&rsquo;t you think I mean it? From now
on I have no interest except you, dear; and I will make
you forget everything which has happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen pressed his hand gratefully, and then withdrew
her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is only going to open everything up again,&rdquo;
she said, in a low, strained voice, &ldquo;and that will be simply
another great mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo; Armstrong&rsquo;s voice was reproachful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you feel all that you say now, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are not yourself now; that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite myself; in fact, I am almost as good as
new.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean physically.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mentally as well. My mind is as clear as it
ever was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, Jack; but you are far away from the influence
which has so controlled you. That is what I
mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a mighty good thing that I am.&rdquo; Armstrong
spoke with emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the time being, no doubt; but soon you will be
able to return to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never return to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked up quickly. Armstrong&rsquo;s words were
spoken so forcibly that they startled her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go back to it,&rdquo; she replied, with equal
emphasis; &ldquo;it is your life, and you must go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have passed through the experience once and for
all time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen found it difficult not to be affected by the convincing
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have made more mistakes than you know of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In your work, do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is only the first draft; you can easily correct
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They could be more easily corrected in the book
than where they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mistakes are in me!&rdquo; Armstrong cried. &ldquo;I am
no humanist; I am an impostor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack! Jack!&rdquo; Helen was really alarmed. &ldquo;You
are putting too much of a tax upon yourself. Remember,
you are not well yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am worse than an impostor,&rdquo; Armstrong continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
excitedly, refusing to be checked: &ldquo;I am a
traitor to the very cause I set myself to further! I
have been false in my duty to it, as I have been in my
obligations to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just the point,&rdquo; Helen interrupted. &ldquo;I
absolved you of your obligations to me weeks ago, so
that part of it is all settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did not absolve myself. I don&rsquo;t understand
what I did or why I did it. Day by day I felt myself
slipping further and further away from you. I was not
strong enough to appreciate what was taking place, and
was powerless to resist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I understood it even then,&rdquo; Helen continued.
&ldquo;I recognized that our marriage was the first mistake,
and decided that I would do my part toward remedying
the error with as little pain as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our marriage was no mistake, except my own unfitness
to be your husband!&rdquo; Armstrong cried, bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Jack,&rdquo; Helen again pleaded. &ldquo;You see, I
have had a much longer time to think the matter out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was all right until I came under the influence,
which completely changed me, just as you told me it
did, time and again. Then, instead of being developed
by it as I should have been, I assimilated nothing but its
limitations and began to go backward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have assimilated far more than that,&rdquo;
Helen insisted, &ldquo;for your personal development through
it all has been tremendous. Otherwise this could not be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Helen.&rdquo; Armstrong was desperate. &ldquo;Let
me tell you how far down I have gone. You know how
eager I was, when we first came, to accomplish some
great achievement. You know how much I admired the
works and personalities of those grand old characters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
whom you have so often heard me speak. Well, I took
up my work. I studied these characters, I wrote about
them, I tried to assimilate their principles and to express
them in words. At length the work was finished. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>
praised it, and I felt that I had proved myself equal to
the undertaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you had,&rdquo; Helen interrupted. &ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> told
me so himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> knows nothing of how ignominiously I failed
to apply these principles to myself. He has read the
noble platitudes with which my book is filled; you have
experienced the unworthy personal expressions as they
have appeared in my every-day life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have said yourself that you could not help
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have been able to; that is where I showed
my utter unfitness for the undertaking. Now do you
understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jack,&rdquo; Helen replied, slowly, after a moment&rsquo;s
pause, &ldquo;I think I do understand; but I also think that
my understanding is clearer than yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it not enable you to forgive me for it all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have already told you that. What you have
said is exactly what I knew you must say when you had
been long enough away from your work. I have never
felt this influence of which you have so often spoken,
but I have recognized its strength by what I have seen.
I do not mean that you need necessarily continue in your
present intensity, but I do mean that whether you recognize
it or not this second nature is your real self.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I tell you that I have no further interest in
my work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think so, Jack, but you have been away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
it for weeks. Perhaps by returning home you could
smother your love of it for a long time, but it would be
there just the same. And without it you could never
express your own individuality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would, at least, be the self you knew before we
came here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but only that. With all the pain, Jack, I have
not been blind to what it has done for you. With all
the misapplication of the principles which you mention
you have gained so much that you could never be the
old self again. I could not respect you if you did.
Surely it would not be following the teachings of these
grand spirits were you to live a life below the standard
which you have shown yourself capable of maintaining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let us live that life together, Helen,&rdquo; Armstrong
begged; &ldquo;let us begin all over again, taking my
mistakes as guiding-posts to keep us from the dangers
against which I have not been strong enough, alone, to
guard myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; Helen withdrew her hands and pressed
them against her tired temples. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that
this is simply repeating the mistake which has caused
all our trouble? Now, at this moment, we are to each
other just what we were when we became engaged, forgetful
of all that has occurred since. Why not recognize
things as they really are, and spare ourselves the
added sorrow which must surely come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you not forgive what has happened since?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have forgiven all that there is to forgive; but I
can&rsquo;t forget the knowledge that has come to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What knowledge is there which refuses to be forgotten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A knowledge of your real self, Jack&mdash;and that self<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
has never belonged to me. It is as distinct and separate
as if it were that of another man. It has been developed
apart from me; it is of such a nature that I cannot
become a part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are so great a part of it already, dear, that
you could not sever yourself from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jack. It is your loyalty, your sense of duty,
that is speaking now. Or perhaps you are far enough
away from what has happened not to see it as clearly as I
do. You have become a part of another life, and your
future belongs to that life and to the woman who has
also become a part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t mean this, Helen. Think what you are
saying!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do mean it, just as I meant it when I said so before,
when you failed to comprehend. It is Inez who must
be your companion in this new life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong did not remonstrate, as he had done before.
It was impossible to misunderstand the conviction in
Helen&rsquo;s voice. He could no longer attribute it to jealousy
or to caprice; he could no longer fail to understand
the meaning of her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have fully deserved all this,&rdquo; he said, at length.
&ldquo;When you first told me of Miss Thayer&rsquo;s feeling toward
me I did not&mdash;I could not&mdash;believe it. Never once,
during all the hours we were together, was there anything
to confirm what you said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not notice this any more than you noticed
other things which happened, Jack; you were too completely
absorbed. But that does not alter the fact, does
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; the fact remains the same. It has only been
since the accident that I have realized it; and this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
one of the two problems which I have to straighten
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you do know now that Inez loves you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong bowed his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it that has at last convinced you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment. &ldquo;It seems uncanny,
Helen, but I have been &lsquo;seeing things.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him questioningly. &ldquo;Seeing things?&rdquo;
she repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; you will think I have lost my mind again, just
as I did; but the doctor says it is not unusual. Inez was
alone with me, after the accident, you know, in the cottage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; encouraged Helen, breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She thought me dead, and&mdash;this is brutal to repeat
to you, Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;go on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, she said she loved me&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you were unconscious, Jack&mdash;you did not know
what was happening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not then, but later. It came to me yesterday, while
lying on the couch,&mdash;almost as in a vision. I spoke to
the doctor about it, and he said that sometimes such
things do happen. If you had not told me what you
did I probably should have thought it nothing but
an uncomfortable dream, but as it was, of course I
understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure now that it was no dream?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I questioned Miss Thayer about some of the
details&mdash;not the most vital ones, of course&mdash;and she corroborated
them. But telling you all this will only make
matters worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jack; I know about it already. Inez has told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
me everything, and the poor girl is distracted. I am
glad that at last you are convinced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew all this?&rdquo; He looked at her in amazement.
&ldquo;You knew it, and have let her stay here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is right that she should remain,&rdquo; Helen answered,
firmly.</p>

<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s voice broke for a moment. &ldquo;And I said
you were jealous!&rdquo; he reproached himself. Then he
continued his appeal. &ldquo;But granting all this, it cannot
settle the matter, deeply as I deplore it. My own
blindness and stupidity are to blame for it, and I must
accept the full responsibility; but my love for you has
never and could never be transferred to her or to any
one else. I have been criminally neglectful, I have been
culpably dense, but through it all you, and you alone,
have been in my heart. I have longed to say this to you
even while the spell was on me. I have longed to fold you
in my arms and ease the pain I have seen you suffer, but
I found myself powerless in this as in all else. Can you
not&mdash;will you not&mdash;believe what I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked up into her husband&rsquo;s face before she
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I wish you were not so conscientious,
Jack&mdash;but of course I don&rsquo;t mean that; only it would
make it easier for me to adhere to my determination
to do what I know is right. I was sure that this
moment would arrive; I know your ideas of duty and
loyalty, and I know that you would sacrifice yourself
and your future rather than be false to either. I believe
that you are sincere in thinking that your sentiments
toward Inez are purely platonic&mdash;I am sure they
would be so long as you were not free to have them
otherwise.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do you insist that they are otherwise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t insist&mdash;I am simply accepting things as they
really are, even though I must suffer by doing so. You
are the only one who does not realize it, unless it be Inez
herself. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> told me, &lsquo;I have never seen two individualities
cast in so identical a mould.&rsquo; Professor Tesso,
who saw you at work together at the library, said, &lsquo;There
is a perfect union of well-mated souls&rsquo;; you yourself,
when we returned from that moonlight ride, said to her,
&lsquo;You are the only one who understands me.&rsquo; It has
simply been your absorption in your work and your
loyalty to me which has kept you from seeing it yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> said that&mdash;Tesso saw us at the library?&rdquo;
Armstrong looked at Helen in bewilderment. &ldquo;You
thought my remark to Miss Thayer possessed anything
more than momentary significance?&rdquo; His face assumed
an expression of still greater concern. &ldquo;I have, indeed,
been more culpable than I realized. Is it not enough
if I tell you that you are all wrong&mdash;that I do not love
any one except the one person I have a right to love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen smiled sadly. &ldquo;No, Jack,&rdquo; she replied, kindly
but firmly, &ldquo;it is all too clear. When you return to
your real life, as you must do, you will return to your
real self as well. Then you will know that I have saved
you from the greatest mistake of all. You and Inez
are meant for each other, and always have been.&rdquo; She
looked up with a brave but unsuccessful attempt to smile.
&ldquo;Perhaps our little experience together has been necessary
in the development of us both, dear. If so, it will
make it easier to believe that our mutual suffering will
not have been in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never accept it, Helen!&rdquo; cried Armstrong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
desperately in earnest. &ldquo;Your devotion to this false
idea will do more than all I have done to wreck our
lives. You must listen to reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it any harder for me than it is,&rdquo; Helen
begged, her voice choking. &ldquo;I am trying to talk calmly,
and to do what I know I must do; but I have been
through so much already. Please don&rsquo;t make it any
harder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong longed to comfort her, but he knew that
she would repulse him if he tried. He watched the conflict
through which the girl was passing and was overwhelmed
by the sense of his own responsibility. He
realized how near the tension was to the breaking-point,
and dared not pursue the subject further. Taking both
her hands in his, he gazed long into her eyes now filled
with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If to give you up is the necessary penalty for the
sorrow I have brought to you,&rdquo; he said, quietly, his
voice breaking as he spoke, &ldquo;it shall be done&mdash;for your
sake, no matter what it means to me; but my love for
you is beyond anything I have ever known before.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XXIX</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>There had been many visitors at the villa during
Armstrong&rsquo;s illness and convalescence. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> had
called several times, being most solicitous for
the speedy recovery of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protg;</i> and the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contessa
Morelli</span>, temporarily thwarted in the solution of her problem,
took advantage of the proximity of her villa to be
frequently on the spot, where she could observe the progress
of affairs under the suddenly changed conditions.</p>

<p>Armstrong had long desired to question the contessa
further in regard to the disquieting conversation he had
held with her upon the occasion of their first meeting;
but the rapidity with which his latent impressions had
become definite realities made him unwilling to allow any
new developments to add to the complexity of the situation
as he had now come to know it. After his interview
with Helen, however, he was convinced that matters
had reached their climax, and he grasped any additional
information as possible material to be used in the
solving of his double dilemma. His opportunity came
on the following day, when he found himself alone with
the contessa upon the veranda, Helen having been called
to another part of the villa by some household demand.</p>

<p>After Helen had made her excuses, Armstrong felt
himself to be the subject of a careful scrutiny on the
part of the contessa. He looked up quickly and met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
her glance squarely. Amlie had a way of making those
she chose feel well acquainted with her, and Armstrong,
during his convalescence, had proved interesting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he asked, smiling, &ldquo;what do you think of
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the contessa&rsquo;s turn to smile, and the question
caught her so unexpectedly that the smile developed
into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been trying to make up my mind,&rdquo; she replied,
frankly. &ldquo;At first I thought him a human thinking-machine,
all head and no heart, but I am beginning
to believe that my early impressions were at fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It gratifies me to hear you say that,&rdquo; Armstrong
answered, calmly. &ldquo;I presume those early impressions
of yours were formed at the library, when Miss Thayer
and I came under your observation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the contessa, unruffled by the quiet
sarcasm which she could but feel. &ldquo;You see, I have
lived here in Italy for several years and have become accustomed
to the sight of saint worship; but it is a novel
experience to see the saint come down off his pedestal
and prove himself to have perfectly good warm blood
coursing through his veins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find it a bit difficult to picture me with
all my worldly attributes even as a temporary saint?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; the contessa answered. &ldquo;Most of the
saints possessed worldly attributes before they attained
the dignity of statues. But think of the confusion
among their worshippers should they follow your example
and again assume the flesh! I imagine their
embarrassment would almost equal yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amlie spoke indifferently, but Armstrong felt the
thrust. It was evident that she had no idea of dropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the subject, and Jack saw nothing else but to accept
it as cheerfully as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not say &lsquo;quite&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the saints were wifeless. Perhaps that is
what made it possible for them to be saints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong laughed in spite of himself. &ldquo;If modern
women were to be canonized, you undoubtedly think
they should be selected from the married class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Canonizing hardly covers it,&rdquo; the contessa replied;
&ldquo;they belong among the martyrs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have not told me why you now feel that
your early impressions were in error,&rdquo; Armstrong resumed,
sensing danger along the path which they had
almost taken, and really eager to learn how far his attitude
had impressed others. The contessa regarded him
critically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many kinds of men,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;and to
a woman of the world it is a necessity to classify those
whom she meets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; queried Armstrong. &ldquo;You are throwing
some most interesting side-lights upon a subject which
my education has entirely overlooked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; Amlie asked, innocently. &ldquo;But your education
has been so far developed in other directions that
you can easily recognize the importance of what I say.
A woman who meets the world face to face must be
able to estimate the elements against which she has to
contend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Into how many classes do you divide us?&rdquo; Armstrong
was interested in her nave presentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The three principal divisions are, of course, single
men, married men, and widowers, but the subdivisions
are really more important. For my own use I find it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
more convenient to separate those I meet into four classes&mdash;the
interesting, the uninteresting, the safe, and the
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have developed an absolute system,&rdquo; Armstrong
asserted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; Amlie responded, cheerfully; &ldquo;without
one you men would have too distinct an advantage
over us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would enlarge on your classification a
little more. It is gratifying to me to know that members
of my sex receive such careful consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose we eliminate the uninteresting&mdash;they
really don&rsquo;t count except in considering matrimony; then
we have to weigh the material advantages they offer
against their lack of interest. This brings us down to the
interesting and safe, and the interesting and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I the honor to be included in one of these two
classes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the contessa replied, frankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask which? You see, my curiosity is getting
the upper hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amlie threw back her head with a hearty laugh. &ldquo;I
was certainly wrong in my first diagnosis,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A
man who was merely a thinking-machine would possess
no curiosity. Usually a learned man is entirely safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you really consider me dangerous?&rdquo; There
was a tone in Armstrong&rsquo;s voice which caused the contessa
to look up at him quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most men would consider that a compliment, Mr.
Armstrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Receiving no reply, Amlie continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wife has such original ideas! I have found
my acquaintance with her positively refreshing.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How does this bear upon our present conversation?&rdquo;
Armstrong inquired, still weighed down by the contessa&rsquo;s
estimate of him. Amlie&rsquo;s frankness showed that no
doubt existed in her mind as to his attitude toward Miss
Thayer, and he felt that denials would be worse than useless.
If impressions such as these lay in the mind of a
casual observer like the contessa it was but natural that
they should assume greater proportions to Helen; and it
was with a foreboding that he heard her name mentioned
in the present conversation. Amlie, however, could not
sense the effect of her words upon her companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we once discussed the same subject,&rdquo; she
replied to his question, &ldquo;and her attitude was most unusual.
She even said that were she convinced that her
husband really loved some other woman she would step
aside and give him a clear field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she say that?&rdquo; Armstrong demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; asserted the contessa. &ldquo;You are a very
lucky man, Mr. Armstrong,&rdquo; she continued, looking into
his face meaningly; &ldquo;my husband is not so fortunate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Armstrong hesitated in order to make no mistake
in his reply, Helen returned accompanied by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>,
and the moment when he could have formulated an answer
had passed. The old man held up a finger reproachfully
as he saw the contessa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have never made another appointment to study
those manuscripts with me,&rdquo; he said, as he took her hand.
&ldquo;Tell me that your interest has not flagged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The librarian spoke feelingly, although he tried to
conceal his disappointment. It was such a triumph that
his work should appeal to one so devoted to a life of social
gayety. Amlie remembered her interview with him
at the library and felt that she deserved the reproach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; she replied, with so much apparent
sincerity in her voice that the old man believed her and
was mollified. &ldquo;I have even received a new impetus from
listening to Mr. Armstrong&rsquo;s enthusiastic account of his
work with you and his impatience to return to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong glanced quickly at Helen as the contessa
attributed to him a desire so opposed to the definite statement
he had made the day before, while <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> smiled
contentedly. Helen gave no sign of having particularly
noticed the remark, but Jack felt keenly his inability at
that moment to set himself right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just about to take my departure,&rdquo; Amlie
continued, &ldquo;and I am glad not to be obliged to leave the
invalid alone. I know how delighted you will be to take
my place,&rdquo; she said to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>.</p>

<p>The old man dropped into the chair the contessa left
vacant, while Armstrong watched the two figures until
they disappeared in the hallway. Then he turned to his
friend&mdash;but it was to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> the priest, the father-confessor,
rather than to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> the librarian. He felt the
seriousness of the situation more acutely than at any
time since a realization of its complexity came to him.
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> watched him curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not so well to-day,&rdquo; he said, at length.
&ldquo;You must go slowly, my son, and give Nature ample
time to make her repairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear even Nature has no remedy sufficiently powerful
to cure my malady,&rdquo; Armstrong replied, bitterly.
&ldquo;I would to God she had!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> was at a loss to understand his manner or his
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; he asked, sympathetically.
&ldquo;Is there some complication of which I know not?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Armstrong bowed his head, overcome for the moment
by an overwhelming sense of his own impotency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; urged the old man, himself affected by
his companion&rsquo;s attitude. &ldquo;I have missed you sadly at
the library these weeks, and I am impatient for your
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never return!&rdquo; cried Armstrong, fiercely. &ldquo;I
have proved myself utterly unworthy of the work I undertook
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son! my son!&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> was aghast at what he
heard. Then his voice softened as he thought he divined
the explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slowly, slowly,&rdquo; he said, soothingly. &ldquo;It is too soon
to put so heavy a burden upon your brain after the
shock it has sustained. There is no haste. Your friends
at the library will be patient, as you must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong easily read what was passing through the
librarian&rsquo;s mind, and it increased his bitterness against
himself. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s calmness, however, quieted him, and
he was more contained as he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that the facts were as you think,&rdquo; he said,
decisively. &ldquo;It would be a positive relief to me if I
could believe that my mind was still unbalanced as a
result of the accident, but it is so nearly recovered that
I must consider myself practically well. But I am glad
of this chance to tell you how we have both been deceived.
It will be a comfort to have you act as my
confessor, and if your affection still holds after my recital
I know that you will advise me as to what future
course I must pursue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In tense, clear-cut sentences Armstrong poured out
to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> the story of the past months as he looked back
upon them. He was frank in speaking of what he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
to be his accomplishments, as he was pitiless in
his arraignment of himself in his failures. He showed
how he had assimilated the lessons of the past only in
his capacity of scribe; he explained how self-centred,
selfish, and neglectful of his duty toward others he had
been in his personal life. He spoke freely of his companionship
with Miss Thayer, of her unquestioned affection
for him, and of the impressions which had been
made upon Helen and the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contessa Morelli</span>. He insisted
simply yet forcefully upon his own loyalty to Helen, not
from a sense of duty, as she firmly believed, but because
his devotion had never wavered.</p>

<p>In speaking of his wife Armstrong went into minute
detail, even going back to his early attempts to interest
her in what had later become his grand passion. He
described her personal attributes, her love of the present
rather than the past, her protective attitude toward
her friend even in the face of such distressing circumstances;
her generosity toward him; and finally her unalterable
conviction that their separation was imperative.</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> listened in breathless silence as Armstrong&rsquo;s
story progressed. He himself had played a part in the
drama of which his companion was ignorant, and a sense
of his own responsibility came to the old man with subtle
force. He recalled his first meeting with Helen at the
library, he remembered their later conversations, and in
his contemplations he almost forgot, for the moment,
the man sitting in front of him in his consideration of
the splendid development, which he had witnessed without
fully realizing it, in this woman whom he had pronounced
unfitted by nature to enter into this side of her
husband&rsquo;s work, as she had longed to do. Now, as a
result of his lack of foresight, she proposed to eliminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
herself from what she considered to be her husband&rsquo;s
problem. &ldquo;It has been more far-reaching than even
you realize,&rdquo; she had said to him at the reception at
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Villa Godilombra</span>, and this was what she had meant.</p>

<p>It was several moments after Armstrong ceased speaking
before <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> raised his eyes, and to Jack&rsquo;s surprise
he saw that they were filled with tears. He naturally
attributed it to the librarian&rsquo;s affection for him and his
sympathy for his sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not have told you this, padre,&rdquo; he said,
sadly, pressing the hand which the old man laid tenderly
upon his. &ldquo;The fault is mine, and I should not
try to shirk the full responsibility by sharing it with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is mine to share with you, my son,&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> replied,
firmly. &ldquo;You have erred, as you state. You have been
to blame for not giving out again, as the example of the
master-spirits of the past should have taught you, those
glorious lessons which impart the joy of living to those
who give as well as to those who receive. But my error
is even heavier. I have lived all my life in this atmosphere,
drinking in the knowledge and the spirit which
have come to you only within the past few months; yet
I failed to recognize in your wife the natural embodiment
of all that the best in humanism teaches. What
you and I have endeavored to assimilate she has felt
and expressed as naturally as she has breathed. She
has shown us humanism in its highest development, purified
and strengthened by her own fine nature, even though
we have given her no opportunity for expression. Thank
God we have recognized it at last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really believe that?&rdquo; cried Armstrong, recalling
his own earlier and less-defined conviction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Beyond a doubt,&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> answered. &ldquo;Let us find
her, that we may tell her what a victory she has won.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong placed a restraining hand upon the old
man&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he said, gently but firmly.
&ldquo;There is much still to be done to prepare her for this
knowledge. At present she would not accept it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must convince her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First of all I must make my peace with Miss
Thayer,&rdquo; Armstrong replied. &ldquo;Until that complication
is relieved there is no hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you feel strong enough for that?&rdquo; asked <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It requires more than strength, padre,&rdquo; Armstrong
replied, seriously; &ldquo;it requires faith in myself, which
at present is sadly lacking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man rose and stood for a moment beside Armstrong&rsquo;s
half-reclining figure. Bending down, he took
his face in his hands and looked full into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me give you that faith,&rdquo; he said, affectionately.
&ldquo;You have already learned by sad experience that you
are not the master of Fate. Let me tell you that by the
same token you are not the victim of Fate. Nature, unerring
in her wisdom, is now giving you the privilege of
being co-partner with her in the final solving of your
great personal problem. Accept the offered opportunity,
my son, and show yourself finally worthy of it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<h3>XXX</h3>

<p>Helen had not overlooked the contessa&rsquo;s remark
to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, even though she gave no evidence at
the time of having heard it. Her conversation
with Jack had given her thoughts much food to feed
upon. His words were so welcome, after the long breach,
his manner so sincere, that she had been nearer to the
yielding-point than he imagined. She had wondered if,
after all, her attitude was justified, in view of his expressed
desire to return to the same relations which had
previously given them both such happiness. Jack&rsquo;s
statement that her insistence upon the present conditions
would do more to wreck their happiness than anything
which he had done, made its impression upon her.
Nothing but the previous intensity of her conviction
that she must yield her place to Inez had held her to the
self-appointed duty which she found so difficult to perform.</p>

<p>When the contessa repeated to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> what appeared
to be an expression of her husband&rsquo;s impatience to return
to his work Helen felt all hesitation vanish. Jack
sympathized with her suffering, and would do all which
lay in his power to make amends. She knew that he
would give up all idea of future work, no matter at what
sacrifice to himself, rather than add another straw to the
burden which he now saw was nearly bearing her down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Yet the affection which she felt for him refused to be
strangled. His very insistence, even though she was
convinced that it was prompted by his sense of duty,
fanned the embers into flame at a time when she was certain
that at last their fire had become extinct. It was
further evidence of her weakness, she told herself, and
she would make superhuman efforts to adhere to the
duty which lay plainly enough before her.</p>

<p>As she was leaving, the contessa placed her arm about
Helen&rsquo;s waist and whispered to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me meddlesome, my dear, but you will
make a great mistake not to stick close beside that big,
splendid husband of yours. They all do it, and I imagine
he has been almost circumspect compared with
most of them. Send the girl away and see if you can&rsquo;t
make him forget his affinity. He is worth the effort, my
dear&mdash;believe me, he is worth the effort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was so taken by surprise by the contessa&rsquo;s
words that she stood speechless, looking at her with
dull, lifeless eyes as she stepped into the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tonneau</span> and
waved a smiling farewell as the motor-car rolled out of
the court-yard. So the contessa was aware of the situation,
and was also convinced of Jack&rsquo;s attachment for
Inez! This was too horrible&mdash;she could not endure
it! Matters must be brought to a head soon or she
would die of mortification! She could not return to the
veranda where she had left <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> and Jack together,
but went up-stairs to her room, where she locked the
door and threw herself upon the bed in a paroxysm of
tears.</p>

<p>Armstrong, on the contrary, had gained strength
from <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s sympathy. He would accept the offered
opportunity and see if at last he could not prove himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
worthy of such glorious co-partnership. Unlike his
previous efforts, if he succeeded it would tend to restore
Helen&rsquo;s happiness as well, and this gave him an added
incentive.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of the next day before he was
able to make his opportunity. Inez had taken a book
and secreted herself in Helen&rsquo;s &ldquo;snuggery&rdquo; in the garden,
but Armstrong&rsquo;s watchful eyes followed her. Waiting
until she had time to become well settled, he strolled
around the garden, finally appearing at the entrance to
prevent her escape. To his surprise she made no such
effort, and appeared more at ease than at any time since
the accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you come to join me?&rdquo; she asked, with much
of her former bearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I may,&rdquo; he replied, advancing to the seat and
taking the place she made for him beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How famously you are getting on!&rdquo; she said, laying
down the volume; &ldquo;you are more like yourself than
I have seen you since the awful accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I may say so,&rdquo; Armstrong replied, watching her
closely, &ldquo;I was just thinking the same of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez flushed. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she answered, frankly,
after a moment&rsquo;s pause.</p>

<p>Armstrong was distinctly relieved by her unexpected
attitude. As he looked back he realized that there had
been a change in her bearing toward him, particularly
during the past week; but until now he had not appreciated
how rapidly her unnatural manner had been
returning to what it was during the early days of their
acquaintance. The apparent effort to avoid him had
disappeared, although he knew of no more reason for
this than he had originally seen cause for its existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Whatever the reason, the change had undoubtedly taken
place, and it made matters easier for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have passed through much together, Miss
Thayer,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I wonder if we realize how
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has certainly been an unusual experience,&rdquo; she
admitted. &ldquo;I expressed this to you at the library&mdash;do
you remember? As I said then, it could hardly occur
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate that now,&rdquo; Armstrong replied, in a low
voice; &ldquo;at that time I do not think I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was much which you could not appreciate
then,&rdquo; continued Inez; &ldquo;and as I look back upon it
there is much which I cannot explain to myself. In
fact, there is a great deal that I blame myself for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blame belongs to me, Miss Thayer,&rdquo; Armstrong
asserted, firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For being away from Helen so much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and for many other acts of selfishness and
neglect. I am to blame for all that you feel against
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against myself?&rdquo; Inez repeated.</p>

<p>Armstrong paused long before he continued. &ldquo;You
have passed through this spell with me,&rdquo; he said, at
length. &ldquo;You, better than any one else, know its power,
and can understand the cause of my attitude toward you
and Helen, which was as inexplicable as it was unpardonable.
And because you understand this I believe
that I shall find you the more ready to forgive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing for which you stand in need of my
forgiveness,&rdquo; Inez said, in a low tone. &ldquo;On the contrary,
there is much for which I have to thank you. It
was a new world to which you introduced me&mdash;one which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
I should not otherwise have known; and having known
it, nothing can ever take it from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If matters had only stopped there,&rdquo; Armstrong
continued, &ldquo;I should have accomplished just what I had
hoped to do. The fascination of the work so held me,
and my desire to further the principles which seemed to
me to represent all which made life worth the living
resulted in blinding me to the possibility that you,
perhaps, were not affected to a similar degree. Your
assistance was so valuable, your companionship so congenial
that I never once realized that I was running any
risk of not performing my full duty toward you as well
as toward Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez could not fail to comprehend the import of his
words, and a feeling of thankfulness passed over her
that this conversation had not come earlier. The days
which had passed since she confided to Helen the secret
which she had so long carried alone had, in their way,
been as full of chaotic conditions as had Armstrong&rsquo;s;
yet it was but recently that she had come to realize the
full importance of what had really happened. The days
at the library, as she looked back upon them, seemed as
a dream. She could close her eyes and bring back the
intoxication of those moments alone with Armstrong in
which she had silently revelled, while he had applied
himself to the task before him unconscious of what was
taking place. She could not deny herself the guilty
pleasure of recalling them, yet little by little these
thoughts had become disassociated from the man with
whom she now came in almost hourly contact. With
this disassociation came a welcome relief. The dread
which she had felt of seeing him and hearing his voice
disappeared as suddenly as it had come. She wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
at it, but she accepted it eagerly without waiting for
an explanation.</p>

<p>With her return to more normal conditions her solicitude
for Helen increased. She was conscious of her
friend&rsquo;s unhappiness, yet she, perhaps, of all the household,
was least aware of the extent of the breach between
her and Armstrong. Helen, naturally perhaps, had confined
her conversation upon this subject to Uncle Peabody
and her husband, so Inez had no thought other than
that all would straighten itself out now that Jack had
become himself again. She had believed that Helen
alone shared her secret with her, so it was with surprise
and mortification that she became aware that Armstrong
himself knew of what had taken place. This was even
more of an ordeal to face than when she made her confession
to Helen, yet it was one which ought to be met
with absolute frankness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand what you mean,&rdquo; she replied, the color
still showing in her face, &ldquo;and I am glad that this opportunity
has come for me to speak freely, even at the
risk of losing your esteem. It is quite true that I, too,
found myself beneath a spell&mdash;but besides this one which
influenced you there was also another and a different
one. I see no reason why I should be ashamed to say
that this other spell was unconsciously exerted by a great
scholar, a noble friend, a loyal husband. The effect of
it was for a time overpowering, but now I can acknowledge
it without injuring any one and express my gratitude
for an influence which must always act for my best
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Thayer!&rdquo; Armstrong cried, overwhelmed by
the revulsion which the girl&rsquo;s words brought to him.
&ldquo;I beg of you not to make virtues out of my errors;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
I cannot accept a tribute such as that, knowing myself
to be unworthy of it. Can you not see that I should
have guarded you from that spell, both for your sake
and for Helen&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez smiled in real happiness that the break had at
last been made. &ldquo;You have given me far more than
you have taken away, dear friend,&rdquo; she replied, gratefully;
&ldquo;now that the experience is past I appreciate it
more than ever. But promise me that you will not give
up this work because of what we all have been through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong shook his head. &ldquo;I shall not take such
chances again,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It could never repeat itself,&rdquo; Inez urged. &ldquo;Because
one has been wounded by the thorn he failed to
see is no reason why he should never pluck another rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose that in plucking the rose something
fell out from next the heart which was inexpressibly dear
to him and was lost forever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez looked up quickly. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not know that Helen insists upon a separation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A separation!&rdquo; Inez repeated, rising to her feet;
&ldquo;why, she worships you! Surely there is some mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; she is convinced that our marriage was all
wrong, and that she stands between me and the continuance
of this work, which she argues is essential for
my development and happiness. It is ridiculous, of
course, but I cannot move her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is right about the work,&rdquo; the girl said, decidedly;
&ldquo;but there is no one in the world better fitted to
enter into it with you than she, if she but knew it. As
I said, you will never take it up in the same way again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
but having learned what it means you can never eliminate
it from your life; and this should draw you and
Helen even closer together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My one remaining labor is to convince her of this,&rdquo;
Armstrong replied, feelingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will help you do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong looked at her steadily for a moment.
&ldquo;There is another point upon which she insists, of
which I have not told you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Inez waited for him to continue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She believes that you and I are foreordained for
each other,&rdquo; Armstrong said, bluntly, &ldquo;and she proposes
to step aside to make the realization of this possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl gazed at her companion in silent amazement.
So this was the cause of Helen&rsquo;s suffering&mdash;this was the
price she was willing to pay as a tribute to her friendship
for her and her love for her husband!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The brave, brave girl!&rdquo; Inez cried, almost overcome
by her emotion. &ldquo;I must make her understand that the
Jack Armstrong I loved was killed at the foot of the
hill of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Settignano</span>. Dear, dear Helen! it is now my
privilege to give her back her happiness as she gave
me back mine!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XXXI</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>It had been to Uncle Peabody that Helen had turned
during all this period, but it was for comfort and
strength rather than for advice. The problem was
hers, and she alone must finally solve it. She had
thought it settled until her conversation with Jack,
which caused a momentary wavering. She repeated
Armstrong&rsquo;s words to Uncle Peabody, and his absolute
conviction that her husband&rsquo;s present attitude was
a normal and final expression encouraged her to question
whether there might not be some other solution than the
one upon which she had determined. Still, it was only
a questioning; as yet she was unprepared to share Uncle
Peabody&rsquo;s conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lean too far backward,&rdquo; he had said to her,
&ldquo;in your efforts to stand by your principles. I have
seen things which were called principles at first become
tyrants and do damage out of all proportion to the
good they would have done had the conditions not
changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the conditions I am watching, uncle,&rdquo; Helen
had replied. &ldquo;I have no &lsquo;principles,&rsquo; as you call them,
which will not joyfully yield themselves. I must not&mdash;I
will not&mdash;stand in the way either of Jack&rsquo;s happiness
or of his development. If I can make myself see any
way by which we can stay together without accomplishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
one or the other of these mistakes, God knows how
eagerly I will again pick up the thread of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Peabody had folded her in his great arms again,
as he had done so many times lately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People have sometimes told me that I am a philosopher,&rdquo;
he said, huskily. &ldquo;They have seen me meet
death in a dear friend, or even one closer to me, with
calmness, sending the departed spirit a wireless &lsquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-voyage</span>&rsquo;
message and considering the incident as fortunate,
as if he had received a promotion. But when
I see one as dear to me as you are, gasping for breath in
what has seemed to be a hopeless and prolonged struggle
for that life which love alone can give you, I must
confess that my stock of philosophy, such as it is, seems
sadly inadequate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now had come the necessity of repeating to him what
the contessa had said, which gave Helen double pain,
knowing, as she did, how much relief her last conversation
had given him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it, Helen,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody said, decisively.
&ldquo;Whatever else one may say of Jack Armstrong,
he is honest, and I can&rsquo;t believe him insincere
in what he said to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not insincerity, dear,&rdquo; she replied, wearily.
&ldquo;He is trying to deceive himself.&mdash;What is it, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>?&rdquo;
she asked, almost petulantly, of the maid as she
approached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsignor <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&mdash;&rdquo; began the maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Armstrong is on the veranda,&rdquo; Helen interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he asks for the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">madama</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; Helen was incredulous. &ldquo;Show him out
here, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>The librarian&rsquo;s face beamed genially as he greeted
her and Uncle Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the maid not made a mistake?&rdquo; Helen asked.
&ldquo;Is it not our invalid whom you wish to see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my daughter, it is you whom I seek. I have
come to make a full though long-delayed acknowledgment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen glanced over to Uncle Peabody, thoroughly
mystified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your husband and I were talking of you yesterday,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;and we both are deeply concerned
to find how erroneous have been our estimates and how
slow we have been to recognize the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Jack had sent him to plead his cause, Helen told
herself, and in her heart she resented the interference.
It was unlike him to intrust so important a matter as
this to another, yet perhaps it was a further evidence
of the new conditions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I not leave you to yourselves?&rdquo; queried Uncle
Peabody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means!&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> cried, hastily. &ldquo;It is most
fitting that you should hear what I am about to say.
Do you remember the first day I met you at the
library?&rdquo; he continued, addressing his question to
Helen.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes for a moment, and an involuntary
shadow of pain passed over her face as she replied,
quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I could ever forget it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> saw it all, and it touched him deeply. &ldquo;I was
unkind to you that day, my daughter&mdash;even cruel. I
thought I understood, but later events have shown me
that my judgment led me far astray.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man had come to a realization at last! This,
at all events, was a comfort to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only in part,&rdquo; she replied, trying to speak cheerfully.
&ldquo;The character-building was going on just as
you said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> said, forcefully&mdash;&ldquo;to a greater extent,
I believe, than any one of us knew. My only excuse
is that I was possessed with a preconceived idea&mdash;the
very thing which I so much object to in others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I quite understand,&rdquo; Helen replied.
&ldquo;Do you mean that, after all his efforts, my husband is
right in his conviction that his work has been a failure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not of your husband that I am thinking now,&rdquo;
the librarian answered; &ldquo;it is of myself&mdash;and you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of me?&rdquo; Helen was genuinely surprised. &ldquo;But
I have never entered into the consideration at all, where
the work at the library was concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have done so; that is just the point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to,&rdquo; Helen cried; &ldquo;but you told me that
I was quite incapable of doing so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I did,&rdquo; replied the librarian, bowing his
head; &ldquo;and that is where I made my great mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have stopped their work where it was&mdash;you
said so yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> again bowed his head. &ldquo;All part of the same
mistake,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Had I encouraged you at that
time you would not only have added much to the work
itself, but you would have saved your husband from his
own great error. I have been much to blame, my daughter,
and you must not hold him responsible for a fault
which is really mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen tried to fathom what was in the old man&rsquo;s mind.
She could not question his sincerity, yet his words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
seemed a mockery. Jack had evidently taken him freely
into his confidence, so there was no reason why she should
not speak freely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Armstrong has apparently told you how unfortunately
his experience has ended in its effect upon
our personal relations. Knowing this, I am sure you
would not intentionally wound me further by seeking to
restore matters to a false basis; yet I can understand
your words in no other way. As you said of my husband,
that day in the library, this time it is your heart
and not your head which finds expression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The librarian gasped with apprehension. &ldquo;Daughter!
daughter!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;have I not made myself
clear! Then let me do so now before any possible misunderstanding
can enter in. I am a humanist by profession&mdash;until
now I believed myself a modern humanist.
When I first knew your husband, he was a youth full of
intelligent appreciation of those ancient marvels which
I delighted to show him. Imagine my joy, twelve years
later, to welcome him again, grown to man&rsquo;s estate, and
to find that the early seeds which I had planted within
him had sent out roots and tendrils so strong as to
hold him firmly in their grasp. Then he brought Miss
Thayer to me&mdash;at first I took her for you, as she was
the kind of woman I had expected him to marry.
She entered into his work with him with the same spirit
as his own, and my foolish old heart rejoiced that such
splendid material had been placed in my hands for the
moulding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why repeat all this?&rdquo; Helen interrupted; &ldquo;I know
it all and accept it all, but what agony to pass through
it still another time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, my daughter,&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> replied, quickly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
&ldquo;we are past the period of your sacrifice now, and have
reached the point of your triumph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My triumph!&rdquo; cried Helen, bitterly. &ldquo;Why do
you hurt me so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patience, dear,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody urged, quietly.
&ldquo;Monsignor <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> has some purpose in mind which
makes this necessary, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am unfortunate in my presentation,&rdquo; the librarian
apologized. &ldquo;The point I wish to make is that up to
the time I met Mrs. Armstrong I had known but one
kind of humanism. I myself had studied the master-spirits
of the past, and had assimilated the principles
which they taught. Mr. Armstrong and Miss Thayer
assimilated their lessons in the same way as I had done;
but we all failed to recognize in this dear lady the natural
expression&mdash;the personification&mdash;of all that we ourselves
had labored so assiduously to acquire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both Helen and Uncle Peabody were listening to the
old man&rsquo;s words with breathless attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that Mrs. Armstrong is a natural humanist?&rdquo;
Uncle Peabody queried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most perfect expression of all that humanism
contains which I can ever hope to see,&rdquo; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> replied,
with feeling. &ldquo;I, more than any one, have prevented
the expression of these attributes which are your natural
heritage; now let me help to merge them with your
husband&rsquo;s undoubted talents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot mean it,&rdquo; Helen said, weakly, sobering
down after the first exhilaration of the old man&rsquo;s words.
&ldquo;I am no humanist, either natural or otherwise. Monsignor
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> evidently means to give me a new confidence,
but it is a mistaken kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must listen to what he says, Helen,&rdquo; Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Peabody insisted. &ldquo;I have known <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> for many
years, and he would make no such statement unless he
felt it to be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all as unknown to me as some foreign language
I have never heard before,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I know,
for I have tried to understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does a bird have to know the technique of music
before it can sing?&rdquo; asked <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is agony for me!&rdquo; cried Helen, in despair.
&ldquo;I can only see in it another opening of the wound, another
barb later to be torn from my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be reasonable, child,&rdquo; urged Uncle Peabody, soothingly.
&ldquo;It seems to me that instead of all this <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>
has brought to you&mdash;to all of us&mdash;the solution of our
problem. Let me ask him a few questions, while you
control yourself and try to understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen acquiesced silently. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s words had seemed
to give her hope, yet she dared not allow herself to hope
again. Limp from exhaustion, worn out by her ceaseless
mental struggle, she had no strength even to oppose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Armstrong has taken her present position,&rdquo;
began Uncle Peabody, &ldquo;because she feels absolutely
that her husband&rsquo;s real expression of himself is that
which he has shown her while under the influence of this
spell which his love of the old-time learning has woven
about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is right,&rdquo; replied the librarian, &ldquo;except that
by an unusual combination of circumstances this influence
overpowered him by its strength, and he should
not be held wholly responsible for his abnormal acts.
This is not the first time I have seen this happen. There
is a peculiar languor in the atmosphere, here in Florence,
impregnated as it is with the romance of centuries, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
is absolutely intoxicating to the mind, but it is rarely
that it succeeds in making itself so felt upon an Anglo-Saxon
temperament. Mr. Armstrong ought never, for
the sake of his own individuality, to give up his fondness
for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liter humaniores</i>, but it is entirely out of
the question for him ever again to become so subject to
their control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She senses this quite as strongly as you do; but
beyond this she feels that he can never retain the development
which has come to him here except in an atmosphere
filled with a comprehension of all which he
holds so dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Armstrong is still in the right,&rdquo; assented
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>, gravely; &ldquo;but there is one point which she still
fails to understand. Her husband&rsquo;s work has been humanistic,
but he himself is but just ready to begin to be
a humanist. She is the one best fitted in every way to
join him at this point, and their two personalities, thus
united, can but produce splendid results.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot believe it,&rdquo; Helen interrupted, speaking
with decision. &ldquo;It has been from Inez and not from
me that he has received his inspiration. Things are
no different now from what they have been: Inez is still
the one to inspire him to attain his best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wrong, dear,&rdquo; spoke a low voice behind
them, as Inez threw her arms about Helen and embraced
her warmly. &ldquo;I surmised what you were discussing,
and took this first opportunity to do my part toward
straightening things out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen sat upright and looked steadily into Inez&rsquo;
smiling face, completely freed for the first time in many
weeks from its care-worn expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you could not look like that if you understood,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
she stammered, still startled by her friend&rsquo;s sudden
appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Armstrong and I have talked it all over, and at
last I understand what should have been clear to me long
ago. You are a dear, brave girl, Helen, and deserve
all the happiness which is in store for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happiness&mdash;to me! Oh, Inez,&rdquo; Helen cried, &ldquo;why
do you all mock me with that word? There can be no
happiness for me, and, unless I do what I propose, it
means misery for every one instead of for me alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; Inez replied, softly, gently smoothing
Helen&rsquo;s hair as she rested her tired head upon her shoulder.
&ldquo;No&mdash;there can be nothing but happiness, now
that all is understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;you love Jack, Inez.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl colored as Helen spoke thus freely in the
presence of others, but her voice was firm as she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;here in the presence of
Mr. Cartwright and Monsignor <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> I ask your permission
to keep in my heart the image of the man I
learned to love while we both were beneath the spell.
That man no longer exists in the flesh, but I still worship
his memory. He can never exist again except as
a part of an experience which could never be repeated.
Is this asking too much, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; cried Helen, gazing at her
helplessly&mdash;&ldquo;what does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means that there have been two Jacks, Helen&mdash;one
of whom became transformed for a time into a
veritable master-spirit of the past. To this man, I
admit, I gave a devotion which I shall never&mdash;could
never&mdash;give to any other; but he died, Helen, when the
spell broke against that wall at the foot of the hill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Settignano</span>. This man, even during his existence, gave
me no devotion in return, and knew not the passion
which he inspired in me. He had no heart, but it was
not his heart I worshipped. To me his mind&mdash;broad,
comprehensive, and understanding&mdash;stood for all that
life could give. The other Jack&mdash;the man you married&mdash;has
never wavered in the love he gave you from
the first. He has suffered from the influence of the
second personality in that he was forced into the background
by the greater strength of this sub-conscious
self; but he has also gained from its influence in the
development which we all have seen. My Jack is dead,
but yours still lives. He needs you, and he longs for the
return to him of the wife he has always loved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inez paused after her long appeal, eager to read a
favorable response in the pale face still gazing at her,
but no change came over the set features. Once or twice
Helen started to speak, but no words came. Uncle Peabody
and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> had followed Inez intently, realizing
that she was pleading the cause far better than they
could. Affected by the scene before them, they found
themselves unable to break the silence. At last Helen&rsquo;s
voice came back to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He longs for the return to him of the wife he has
always loved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She repeated Inez&rsquo; words slowly, in the form of a
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; her friend replied; &ldquo;he is waiting for
you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, no!&rdquo; Helen cried, brokenly, covering her
face with her hands; &ldquo;it is all a mistake. You are
all doing this for my sake, and it is not the truth&mdash;it
is not the truth!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are ill, Helen!&rdquo; cried Inez, alarmed by her appearance
as well as by the wildness of her words; &ldquo;come,
let me take you to your room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unresistingly Helen suffered herself to be led into the
house, leaving Uncle Peabody and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> looking apprehensively
at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He longs&mdash;for the return to him&mdash;of the wife&mdash;he
has always loved,&rdquo; Helen murmured over and over again,
as Inez and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span> undressed her and gently put her
into bed. She seemed indifferent to what Inez said to
her, and conscious only of the words which she kept repeating.
Thoroughly frightened, Inez left her in <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Annetta</span>&rsquo;s
care while she rushed down-stairs to summon the
doctor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>



<hr class="l1"/>
<h3>XXXII</h3>
<hr class="l2"/>


<p>For a few days Helen&rsquo;s condition was grave enough
to warrant the anxiety which pervaded the entire
household. Dr. Montgomery was again pressed
into service, and found his skill taxed to the utmost to
meet the condition in which he found his new patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a great surprise to me,&rdquo; he remarked to
Uncle Peabody, shaking his head ominously. &ldquo;I have
made it a point to watch Mrs. Armstrong throughout
the shock and the strain of her husband&rsquo;s accident, anticipating
that this nervous reaction might occur; but
the time when it would naturally have happened is now
long since passed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Cartwright reluctantly explained to the doctor
enough of the facts to assist him to a proper understanding
of the case, and with sympathies fully enlisted
his efforts were redoubled. The patient herself proved
to be his greatest obstacle. Try as he would, he could
not arouse in her any interest in her recovery. She accepted
his services and those of the nurse without question,
but in an apathetic manner. Armstrong, Inez, and
Uncle Peabody hovered about the sick-chamber, eagerly
grasping such information as the nurse and the doctor
were able to give them, the anxious lines in their faces
becoming deeper as the hours passed by.</p>

<p>But it was naturally upon Armstrong that the burden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
rested most heavily. He had been given the fullest details
of the conference in the garden which immediately
preceded Helen&rsquo;s collapse, and her replies to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span>&rsquo;s appeal
showed him, better even than his last conversation
with her, how seriously she had been affected. For this
he alone was responsible, and he was equally responsible
for the illness which came as a final result of it all. He
had hoped that when <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> awakened her to a knowledge
of her own splendid development she would accept
his plea that they take up their new life together, but
this expectation had been in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has come too late,&rdquo; he said, bitterly, to Uncle
Peabody. &ldquo;We can only imagine the tortures through
which the poor girl has passed by the severity of this
reaction. She has been forcing herself to make this supreme
sacrifice, which she believes is necessary, and has
succeeded at last in destroying that love which I know
she felt for me even through the worst of the crisis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She loves you still, Jack,&rdquo; replied Uncle Peabody,
whose complete sympathy had been won by Armstrong&rsquo;s
attitude during the trying days they were passing
through together. &ldquo;It is this which has made it so
hard for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only your ever-present optimism,&rdquo; the younger
man replied, sadly. &ldquo;Now that I see myself as I have
really been during these past weeks, I cannot share it
with you, much as I wish I could. If I, having actually
experienced this spell and knowing its force, find it so
impossible to explain to myself this long series of inexplicable
events, how can I expect anything other than
this generous but unfortunate conviction that her self-sacrifice
is necessary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face contracted as he spoke, and the veins upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
his forehead stood out boldly against the fair skin, still
colorless from his prolonged illness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the worst of it all is that I can make no sacrifice
which can possibly accomplish anything,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;She&mdash;she must suffer on indefinitely for my selfishness,
for my neglect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me speak to her just once more,&rdquo; Inez pleaded,
in real pity for the man beside her. &ldquo;When she is
strong enough, perhaps I can make her understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, firmly, yet showing his appreciation
of her thought for him, &ldquo;she has endured enough
already. The very mention of her husband can only
revive unhappy memories. She shall at least be spared
any further pleading on my behalf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the doctor pronounced the danger-point
passed, and the relief which the announcement brought
gave Armstrong the necessary strength to enable him
to take upon himself the details of packing and closing
up the house, and getting everything in readiness to
leave for home as soon as Helen should be strong enough
to travel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The place has been hateful to her all these weeks,&rdquo;
he explained, &ldquo;and she must be freed from every scene
which suggests what has passed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he went from one part of the villa to another, he
was constantly reminded with painful forcefulness of the
days which they had first enjoyed there together. The
flowers in the garden, the singing of the birds in the
trees, the distant view of the city&mdash;each possessed a personal
significance. &ldquo;I love the present,&rdquo; she had said
to him&mdash;&ldquo;I love the sky, the air, the sunshine, and the
flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Happy, buoyant nature&mdash;the natural humanist! She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
assimilated all that was best in life, and had he given her
the opportunity would have breathed it out again to
those around her richer and more inspiring because of
its contact with her own rare self! Fool that he had
been! With the riches of the past lying at his hand to
be drawn upon for material, he had selfishly insisted
that his own methods of using them were the only ones,
recognizing too late the inspiration and the real assistance
which she was amply able to give him in transforming
these riches into even purer gold by the magic
touch of the present. Armstrong groaned as the irony
of it came to him.</p>

<p>Helen recovered slowly, and with a sweetness which
touched the hearts of all about her. Inez and Uncle
Peabody were with her much of the time, but Armstrong,
true to his conviction that he had become distasteful to
her, waited to be asked for; and Helen did not ask. The
only event which happened to interrupt the even tenor
of the days was a call from the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contessa Morelli</span>, who
was solicitous for her condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make some excuse,&rdquo; Helen said, quietly, to Inez,
who announced the visitor. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything to
hurt her feelings, but I really can&rsquo;t see her. She does
not understand the life I know and love, and I don&rsquo;t
want to understand hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was Jack whom the contessa met as she took her
departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so relieved to know that your wife is in no
danger,&rdquo; she said, sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So are we all,&rdquo; Armstrong replied, in a perfunctory
way, still feeling ill at ease in the contessa&rsquo;s presence.
&ldquo;This villa will soon be considered as a hospital if any
more of us become invalids.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Thayer is not ill?&rdquo; inquired the contessa, smiling
archly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is quite well, I believe,&rdquo; he replied, coldly, but
with an effort to be civil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How fortunate!&rdquo; Amlie continued. &ldquo;With Mrs.
Armstrong in no danger and Miss Thayer in good health,
you will soon, no doubt, resume your charming <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tte--ttes</i>
at the library?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contessa was endeavoring to be mischievous, but
Armstrong was in no mood for her pleasantries. He
resented the words no less than the expression upon her
face. Yet he himself was partially responsible, and this
thought kept back the words upon his lips which if spoken
would have been regretted. He looked intently into her
face before he answered, and the contessa&rsquo;s smile faded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instead of replying to your question,&rdquo; Armstrong
said, quietly, with his eyes still fixed upon her, &ldquo;may I
not ask you a favor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you may ask it,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;but that does
not mean that I must grant it, does it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not grant it unless you choose,&rdquo; pursued
Armstrong; &ldquo;but at least I shall have the satisfaction
of asking it: will you not add one more class into which
you separate the men you meet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contessa laughed merrily. &ldquo;What a curious request
to be made so seriously!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Of
whom shall the new class be composed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of those men who are husbands and who love their
wives,&rdquo; Armstrong replied, feelingly; &ldquo;who despise intrigue
and disloyalty and hypocrisy in either sex; who
consider honor and life as synonyms; and who, even for
the sake of civility, cannot allow misinterpretations to
cast a shadow upon the sanctity of marriage.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; cried the contessa, making a pretty
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moue</i> as she rose and moved toward the veranda; &ldquo;and
I thought he had no temperament! Shall I put you
in this exotic class? Oh no; you would be so lonesome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not expect you to understand,&rdquo; Armstrong
replied, in a low tone, biting his lip with vexation.</p>

<p>Amlie watched his expression intently, a complete
change coming over her manner. The flippant bearing
was gone; the smile, aggravating as it was attractive,
vanished. She took a step toward him as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do understand,&rdquo; she said, slowly, in a low,
tense voice. &ldquo;Perhaps I ought to feel shamed by your
contempt and indignant at your criticism. On the contrary,
I am glad that I incurred both, for by it I have
learned that a man can be honest, and that appearances
are not always the safest guides. What you have said
is what a woman understands by instinct; anything
different is what she learns&mdash;from men. Will you forgive
me? I shall not offend again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His surprise at this new and unexpected view of the
contessa&rsquo;s character was so great that it was only instinctively
that he pressed the dainty hand which was
held out to him. For a moment their eyes met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that you and your wife might both have come
into my life earlier,&rdquo; she said, simply, and then turned
quickly to the door and was in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tonneau</span> of her motor-car
before Armstrong could offer to assist her. So, as
the machine moved away, he stood on the veranda, bowing
his acknowledgment of her radiant smile into which
a new element had entered.</p>

<p>Then Armstrong turned back into the hallway, where
he met the doctor and Uncle Peabody coming down the
stairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she asked for me yet?&rdquo; he inquired, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Dr. Montgomery answered, with that understanding
which is a part of the physician&rsquo;s profession.
Armstrong turned away to conceal his face, which he
felt must show all that was passing through his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would go to her, anyway,&rdquo; the doctor
continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you are suggesting, doctor&mdash;I
want to do it so much&mdash;but I must not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be necessary to talk with her soon about our
future plans, Jack,&rdquo; Uncle Peabody said, seeing a way
to accomplish their purpose. &ldquo;Dr. Montgomery says
that Helen is strong enough now to discuss the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armstrong looked from one to the other with uncertainty.
&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said, at length. &ldquo;She
must be consulted about that, and I am the one to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He chose the morning for his visit to her&mdash;a morning
filled with the sunshine she loved so well. He plucked
a handful of the fragrant blossoms from the garden,
hoping that the odor might recall to her some of the
happy moments they had experienced together. The
very perfume rising from the redolent petals seemed to
accuse him as he stood before her door awaiting the
nurse&rsquo;s response to his knock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; he asked, looking across the room
to the bed where Helen lay propped up with pillows,
so that she could look out of the window into the garden,
even though the tops of the trees alone rewarded her gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Helen weakly replied, yet with a smile,
and the nurse discreetly left them to themselves.</p>

<p>Armstrong seated himself on a chair near the bed and
gazed in silence at the thin, pale features of the woman
before him. This was the wreck of the beautiful girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
he had married and brought here to Florence for her
honeymoon. What a honeymoon!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you came to me at last,&rdquo; Helen said,
quietly, interrupting his convicting thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; The words brought him to himself.
Mastering his emotion as best he could, he took her
thin hand in his, and the fact that she did not withdraw
it gave him courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have longed to come to you each day, but you
asked me not to make it harder for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you came to me at last,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

<p>How should he begin? The sentences he had thought
out carefully, which might convey his necessary message
and yet spare her, seemed too cold, too meaningless.
He glanced up at her helplessly, and the expression
on her face helped him to his purpose. Impulsively
drawing his chair still nearer to the bed, he poured out
to her the self-incriminations which had haunted him for
days. In a torrent of pitiless words he pictured himself
without mercy. There was no plea for reconsideration,
no thought of future readjustment. The one idea was
to let her know how fully he realized all that had happened,
how powerless he felt himself to make restitution,
and his determination to do what now remained to make
her future as little overcast as possible by the events
which had already taken place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not have come now except that it is necessary,&rdquo;
he said, brokenly. &ldquo;I know that to see me must
recall unhappy recollections, but there are some matters
which we must talk over together. I have not come to
plead for any reconsideration&mdash;you were right in what
you said the last time we talked about it, as you have
been in all else. Our marriage was a mistake, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
I who have made it so. I no longer ask that we try
to restore matters to their former position. The only
sacrifice within my power is to give you a chance to recover
as much as you can of what I have made you lose.
The penalty is hard, but well deserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not look into her face as he spoke, lest he lose
his courage before all was said. &ldquo;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> has told you
what you have taught us both, which is another debt
I owe you. It should be some little consolation, dear,
to know that your expression and your understanding
have been so much clearer than those of this librarian,
whom I have considered infallible; than those of your
husband, whom in the past I know you have respected and
loved. Thank God for that love!&rdquo; he repeated, abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is really true that my &lsquo;dear present&rsquo; is
worth something, after all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your &lsquo;dear present&rsquo; is the saving clause. Without
it we limit ourselves beyond the hope of recovery, just
as I have done. The glories of the past are as splendid
and as important as I ever painted them, but they must
be awakened with the breath of present necessities. You
have always felt this and expressed it; I have known it
only since you taught it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; she answered, simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am forgetting my errand,&rdquo; Armstrong continued,
bracing himself for a final effort. &ldquo;As soon as
you are able to travel you will, of course, wish to return
home. It may be that, for the sake of appearances, you
will wish me to go with you, in which case I shall make it
as easy as possible for you. Or you can return with Uncle
Peabody, as he tells me you once spoke to him of doing.
He is eager to do anything you wish, but he has plans
which need to be arranged after you have once decided.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s gaze rested firmly upon her husband&rsquo;s half-averted
face, watching the changing expressions, reading
the unspoken words. &ldquo;He longs for the return to him
of the wife he has always loved&rdquo; rang in her ears, and
now for the first time it seemed to ring true. Her mind
was moving fast as Armstrong ceased speaking, and even
when she replied, a moment later, it was not an answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is Inez going to do?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as we close the villa she will go to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pension</i>
where the Sinclair girls were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will stay in Florence?&rdquo; Helen asked, surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; she has arranged with <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cerini</span> to work with him
upon his <span class="name">Humanistic Studies</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen withdrew her hand from his as she leaned back
upon the pillow and closed her eyes. Armstrong regarded
her anxiously, fearful lest their interview had
been too great a strain upon her returning strength;
but as he looked her eyes opened again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must know at once whether I prefer to return
home with you or with Uncle Peabody?&rdquo; she asked,
faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at once,&rdquo; he replied, leaning nearer to catch the
low-spoken words&mdash;&ldquo;not until you are strong enough to
decide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt both her arms about his neck, and in
his ear she whispered, &ldquo;Let me go with you, Jack; but
not to Boston&mdash;take me to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fiesole</span>!&rdquo;</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

Gutenberg-tm License.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
